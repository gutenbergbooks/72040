ENGAGEMENT</p>
</div>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br>
<span class="fs80">“ALONE IN A GREAT CITY”</span></h2>

<p>“Now, Tavia!”</p>

<p>“Now, Dorothy!” mocked Octavia Travers,
making a little face as she did so; but then, Tavia
Travers could afford to “make faces,” possessing
as she did such a naturally pretty one.</p>

<p>“We must decide immediately,” her chum, Dorothy
Dale, said decidedly, “whether to continue
in the train under the river and so to the main
station, or to change for the Hudson tube. You
know, we can walk from the tube station at Twenty-third
Street to the hotel Aunt Winnie always
patronizes.”</p>

<p>“With these heavy bags, Doro?”</p>

<p>“Only a block and a half, my dear Tavia. You
are a strong, healthy girl.”</p>

<p>“But I do so like to have people do things for
me,” sighed Tavia, clasping her hands. “And
taxicabs are <em>so</em> nice.”</p>

<p>“And expensive,” rejoined Dorothy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>“Of course. That is what helps to make them
nice,” declared Tavia. “Doro, I just love to
throw away money!”</p>

<p>“You only think you do, my dear,” her chum
said placidly. “Once you had thrown some of
your own money away—some of that your father
sent you to spend for your fall and winter outfit—you
would sing a different tune.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I would—not if by throwing it
away I really made a splurge, Doro,” sighed
Tavia. “I <em>love</em> money.”</p>

<p>“You mean, you love what money enables us to
have.”</p>

<p>“Yep,” returned the slangy Tavia. “And taxicab
rides eat up money horribly. We found that
out, Doro, when we were in New York before,
that time—before we graduated from dear old
Glenwood School.”</p>

<p>“But <em>this</em> isn’t getting us anywhere. To return——”</p>

<p>“‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Revenons à nos moutons!</i>’ Sure! I know,”
gabbled Tavia. “Let us return to our mutton.
He, he! Have I forgotten my French?”</p>

<p>“I really think you have,” laughed Dorothy
Dale. “Most of it. And almost everything else
you learned at dear old Glenwood, Tavia. But,
quick! Decide, my dear. How shall we enter New
York City? We are approaching the Manhattan
Transfer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p>“Mercy! So quick?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Just like that.”</p>

<p>“I tell you,” whispered Tavia, suddenly becoming
confidential, her sparkling eyes darting a
glance ahead. “Let’s leave it to that nice man.”</p>

<p>“Who? What man do you mean, Tavia?” demanded
Dorothy, her face at once serious. “Do
try to behave.”</p>

<p>“Am behaving,” declared Tavia, nodding.
“But I’m a good sport. Let’s leave it to him.”</p>

<p>“Whom do you mean?”</p>

<p>“You know. That nice, Western looking young
man who opened the window for us that time. He
is sitting in that chair just yonder. Don’t you
see?” and she indicated a pair of broad shoulders
in a gray coat, above which was revealed a
well-shaped head with a thatch of black hair.</p>

<p>“Do consider!” begged Dorothy, catching Tavia’s
hand as though she feared her chum was
about to get up to speak to this stranger. “This
is a public car. We are observed.”</p>

<p>“Little silly!” said Tavia, smiling upon her
chum tenderly. “You don’t suppose I would do
anything so crude—or rude—as to speak to the
gentleman? ‘Fie! fie! fie for shame! Turn your
back and tell his name!’ And you don’t know it,
you know you don’t, Doro.”</p>

<p>Dorothy broke into smiles again and shook her
head; her own eyes, too, dancing roguishly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>“I only know his initials,” she said.</p>

<p>“What?” gasped Tavia Travers in something
more than mock horror.</p>

<p>“Yes. They are ‘G. K.’ I saw them on his
bag. Couldn’t help it,” explained Dorothy, now
laughing outright. “But decide, dear! Shall we
change at Manhattan Transfer?”</p>

<p>“If <em>he</em> does—there!” chuckled Tavia. “We’ll
get out if the nice Western cowboy person does.
Oh! he’s a whole lot nicer looking than Lance
Petterby.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, Tavia! Haven’t you forgotten
Lance yet?”</p>

<p>“Never!” vowed Tavia, tragically. “Not till
the day of my death—and then some, as Lance
would himself say.”</p>

<p>“You are incorrigible,” sighed Dorothy.
Then: “He’s going to get out, Tavia!”</p>

<p>“Oh! oh! oh!” crowed her chum, under her
breath. “You were looking.”</p>

<p>“Goodness me!” returned Dorothy, in some exasperation.
“Who could miss that hat?”</p>

<p>The young man in question had put on his
broad-brimmed gray hat. He was just the style
of man that such a hat became.</p>

<p>The young man lifted down the heavy suitcase
from the rack—the one on which Dorothy had
seen the big, black letters, “G. K.” He had a second
suitcase of the same description under his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
feet. He set both out into the aisle, threw his
folded light overcoat over his arm, and prepared
to make for the front door of the car as the train
began to slow down.</p>

<p>“Come on, now!” cried Tavia, suddenly in a
great hurry.</p>

<p>But Dorothy had to put on her coat, and to
make sure that she looked just right in the mirror
beside her chair. All Tavia had to do was to toss
her summer fur about her neck and grab up her
traveling bag.</p>

<p>“We’ll be left!” she cried. “The train doesn’t
stop here long.”</p>

<p>“You run, then, and tell them to wait,” Dorothy
said calmly.</p>

<p>They were, however, the last to leave the car—the
last to leave the train, in fact—at the elevated
platform which gives a broad view of the New
Jersey meadows.</p>

<p>“My goodness me!” gasped Tavia, as the
brakeman helped them to the platform, and waved
his hand for departure. “My goodness me!
We’re clear at this end of this awful platform,
and the tube train stops—and of course starts—at
the far end. A mile to walk with these bags
and not a redcap in sight. Oh, yes! there’s one,”
she added faintly.</p>

<p>“Redcap?” queried Dorothy. “Oh! you mean
a porter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” Tavia said. “Of course you would be
slow. Everybody’s got a porter but us.”</p>

<p>Dorothy laughed mellowly. “Who’s fault do
you intimate it is?” she asked. “We might have
been the first out of the car.”</p>

<p>“<em>He’s</em> got one,” whispered Tavia.</p>

<p>Oddly enough her chum did not ask “Who?”
this time. She, too, was looking at the back of the
well-set-up young man whose initials seemed to
be G. K. He stood confronting an importunate
porter, whose smiling face was visible to the girls
as he said:</p>

<p>“Why, Boss, yo’ can’t possibly kerry dem two
big bags f’om dis end ob de platfo’m to de odder.”</p>

<p>The porter held out both hands for the big
suitcases carried by the Western looking young
man, who really appeared to be physically much
better able to carry his baggage than the negro.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose two-bits has anything to do
with your desire to tote my bag?” suggested the
white man, and the listening girls knew he must
be smiling broadly.</p>

<p>“Why, Boss, <em>yo’</em> can’t earn two-bits carryin’
bags yere; but <em>I</em> kin,” and the negro chuckled delightedly
as he gained possession of the bags.
“Come right along, Boss.”</p>

<p>As the porter set off, the young man turned and
saw Dorothy Dale and Tavia Travers behind
him. Besides themselves, indeed, this end of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
long cement platform was clear. Other passengers
from the in-bound train had either gone forward
or descended into the tunnel under the
tracks to reach the north-side platform. The only
porter in sight was the man who had taken G. K.’s
bags.</p>

<p>The weight of the shiny black bags the girls
carried was obvious. Indeed, perhaps Tavia sagged
perceptibly on that side—and intentionally;
and, of course, her hazel eyes said “Please!” just
as plain as eyes ever spoke before.</p>

<p>Off came the broad-brimmed hat just for an instant.
Then he held out both hands.</p>

<p>“Let me help you, ladies,” he said, with the
pleasantest of smiles. “Seeing that I have obtained
the services of the only Jasper in sight,
you’d better let me play porter. Going to take
this tube train, ladies?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed!” cried Tavia, twinkling with
smiles at once, and first to give him a bag.</p>

<p>Dorothy might have hesitated, but the young
man was insistent and quick. He seized both bags
as a matter of course, and Dorothy Dale could
not pull hers away from him.</p>

<p>“You must let us pay your porter, then,” she
said, in her quietly pleasant way.</p>

<p>“Bless you! we won’t fight over that,” chuckled
the young man.</p>

<p>He was agreeably talkative, with that wholesome,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
free, yet chivalrous manner which the girls,
especially the thoughtful Dorothy, had noticed
as particular attributes of the men they had met
during their memorable trip to the West, some
months before.</p>

<p>She noticed, too, that his attentions to Tavia
and herself were nicely balanced. Of course,
Tavia, as she always did, began to run on in her
light-hearted and irresponsible way; but though
the young man listened to her with a quiet smile,
he spoke directly to Dorothy quite as often as he
did to the flyaway girl. He did not seek to take
advantage of Tavia’s exuberant good spirits as
so many strangers might have done.</p>

<p>Tavia’s flirtatious ways were a sore trial to her
more sober chum; but this young man seemed to
understand Tavia at once.</p>

<p>“Of course, you’re from the West?” Tavia finished
one “rattlety-bang” series of remarks with
this direct question.</p>

<p>“Of course I am. Right from the desert—Desert
City, in fact,” he said, with a quiet smile.</p>

<p>“Oh!” gasped Tavia, turning her big eyes on
her chum. “Did you hear that, Doro? Desert
City!”</p>

<p>For the girls, during their visit to the West had,
as Tavia often claimed in true Western slang,
helped “put Desert City on the map.”</p>

<p>Dorothy, however, did not propose to let this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
conversation with a strange man become at all
personal. She ignored her chum’s observation
and, as the city-bound tube train came sliding in
beside the platform, she reached for her own bag
and insisted upon taking it from the Westerner’s
hand.</p>

<p>“Thank you so much,” she said, with just the
right degree of firmness as well as of gratitude.</p>

<p>Perforce he had to give up the bag, and Tavia’s,
too, for there was the red-capped, smiling
negro expectant of the “two-bits.”</p>

<p>“You are <em>so</em> kind,” breathed Tavia, with one
of her wonderful “man-killing” glances at the
considerate G. K., as Dorothy’s cousin, Nat
White, would have termed her expression of countenance.</p>

<p>G. K. was polite and not brusk; but he was not
flirtatious. Dorothy entered the Hudson tube
train with a feeling of considerable satisfaction.
G. K. did not even enter the car by the same door
as themselves nor did he take the empty seat opposite
the girls, as he might have done.</p>

<p>“There! he is one young man who will not flirt
with you, Tavia,” she said, admonishingly.</p>

<p>“Pooh! I didn’t half try,” declared her chum,
lightly.</p>

<p>“My dear! you would be tempted, I believe, to
flirt with a blind man!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Doro! Never!” Then she dimpled suddenly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
glancing out of the window as the train
swept on. “<em>There’s</em> a man I didn’t try to flirt
with.”</p>

<p>“Where?” laughed Dorothy.</p>

<p>“Outside there beside the tracks,” for they had
not yet reached the Summit Avenue Station, and
it is beyond that spot that the trains dive into the
tunnel.</p>

<p>“We passed him too quickly then,” said Dorothy.
“Lucky man!”</p>

<p>The next moment—or so it seemed—Tavia
began on another tack:</p>

<p>“To think! In fifteen minutes, Doro my dear,
we shall be ‘Alone in a Great City.’”</p>

<p>“How alone?” drawled her friend. “Do you
suppose New York has suddenly been depopulated?”</p>

<p>“But we shall be alone, Doro. What more
lonesome than a crowd in which you know nobody?”</p>

<p>“How very thoughtful you have become of a
sudden. I hope you will keep your hand on your
purse, dear. There will be some people left in
the great city—and perhaps one may be a pickpocket.”</p>

<p>The electric lights were flashed on, and the
train soon dived into the great tunnel, “like a
rabbit into his burrow,” Tavia said. They had to
disembark at Grove Street to change for an uptown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
train. The tall young Westerner did likewise,
but he did not accost them.</p>

<p>The Sixth Avenue train soon whisked the girls
to their destination, and they got out at Twenty-third
Street. As they climbed the steps to the
street level, Tavia suddenly uttered a surprised
cry.</p>

<p>“Look, will you, Doro?” she said. “Right
ahead!”</p>

<p>“G. K.!” exclaimed her friend, for there was
the young man mounting the stairs, lugging his
two heavy suitcases.</p>

<p>“Suppose he goes to the very same hotel?”
giggled Tavia.</p>

<p>“Well—maybe that will be nice,” Dorothy said
composedly. “He looks nice enough for us to
get acquainted with him—in some perfectly
proper way, of course.”</p>

<p>“Whew, Doro!” breathed Tavia, her eyes opening
wide again. “You’re coming on, my dear.”</p>

<p>“I am speaking sensibly. If he is a nice young
man and perfectly respectable, why shouldn’t he
find some means of meeting us—if he wants to—and
we are all at the same hotel?”</p>

<p>“But——”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe in flirting,” said Dorothy Dale,
calmly, yet with a twinkle in her eyes. “But I
certainly would not fly in the face of Providence—as
Miss Higley, our old teacher at Glenwood,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
would say—and refuse to meet G. K. He looks
like a really nice young man.”</p>

<p>“Doro!” gasped Tavia. “You amaze me! I
shall next expect to see the heavens fall!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be ridiculous,” said her friend, as they
reached the exit of the tube station and stepped
out upon the sidewalk.</p>

<p>There was the Westerner already dickering
with a boy to carry his bags.</p>

<p>“<em>He</em> likes to throw money away, too!” whispered
Tavia. “I suppose we must be economical
and carry ours.”</p>

<p>“As there seems to be no other boy in sight—yes,”
laughed her friend.</p>

<p>“That young man gets the best of us every
time,” complained Tavia under her breath.</p>

<p>“He is typically Western,” said Dorothy. “He
is prompt.”</p>

<p>But then, the boy starting off with the heavy
bags in a little box-wagon he drew, the young man
whose initials were G. K., turned with a smile to
the two girls.</p>

<p>“Ladies,” he said, lifting his hat again, “at the
risk of being considered impertinent, I wish to ask
you if you are going my way? If so I will help
you with your bags, having again cinched what
seems to be the only baggage transportation facilities
at this station.”</p>

<p>For once Tavia was really speechless. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
Dorothy who quite coolly asked the young man:</p>

<p>“Which is your direction?”</p>

<p>“To the Fanuel,” he said.</p>

<p>“That is where we are going,” Dorothy admitted,
giving him her bag again without question.</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Tavia, “getting into the picture
with a bounce,” as she would have expressed
it. “Aren’t you the <em>handiest</em> young man!”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he replied, laughing. “That is
a reputation to make one proud. I never was in
this man’s town before, but I was recommended
to the Fanuel by my boss.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Tavia hastened to take the lead in the
conversation. “We’ve been here before—Doro
and I. And we always stop at the Fanuel.”</p>

<p>“Now, I look on that as a streak of pure luck,”
he returned. He looked at Dorothy, however,
not at Tavia.</p>

<p>The boy with the wagon went on ahead and the
three voyagers followed, laughing and chatting,
G. K. swinging the girls’ bags as though they were
light instead of heavy.</p>

<p>“I want awfully to know his name,” whispered
Tavia, when they came to the hotel entrance and
the young man handed over their bags again and
went to the curb to get his own suitcases from
the boy.</p>

<p>“Let’s,” added Tavia, “go to the clerk’s desk
and ask for the rooms your Aunt Winnie wrote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
about. Then I’ll get a chance to see what he
writes on the book.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Tavia!” exclaimed Dorothy.
“We’ll do nothing of the kind. We must go to
the ladies’ parlor and send a boy to the clerk, or
the manager, with our cards. This is a family
hotel, I know; but the lobby and the office are
most likely full of men at this time in the day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! Come on, then, Miss Particular,”
groaned Tavia. “And we didn’t even bid him
good-bye at parting.”</p>

<p>“What did you want to do?” laughed Dorothy.
“Weep on his shoulder and give him some trinket,
for instance, as a souvenir?”</p>

<p>“Dorothy Dale!” exclaimed her friend. “I believe
you have something up your sleeve. You
seem just <em>sure</em> of seeing this nice cowboy person
again.”</p>

<p>“All men from the West do not punch cattle
for a living. And it would not be the strangest
thing in the world if we should meet G. K. again,
as he is stopping at this hotel.”</p>

<p>However, the girls saw nothing more of the
smiling and agreeable Westerner that day. Dorothy
Dale’s aunt had secured by mail two rooms
and a bath for her niece and Tavia. The girls
only appeared at dinner, and retired early. Even
Tavia’s bright eyes could not spy out G. K. while
they were at dinner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>Besides, the girls had many other things to
think about, and Tavia’s mind could not linger entirely
upon even as nice a young man as G. K.
appeared to be.</p>

<p>This was their first visit to New York alone, as
the more lively girl indicated. Aunt Winnie
White had sprained her ankle and could not come
to the city for the usual fall shopping. Dorothy
was, for the first time, to choose her own fall
and winter outfit. Tavia had come on from Dalton,
with the money her father had been able to
give her for a similar purpose, and the friends
were to shop together.</p>

<p>They left the hotel early the next morning and
arrived at the first huge department store on their
list almost as soon as the store was opened, at nine
o’clock.</p>

<p>An hour later they were in the silk department,
pricing goods and “just looking” as Tavia said.
In her usual thoughtless and incautious way, Tavia
dropped her handbag upon the counter while she
used both hands to examine a particular piece of
goods, calling Dorothy’s attention to it, too.</p>

<p>“No, dear; I do not think it is good enough,
either for the money or for your purpose,” Dorothy
said. “The color <em>is</em> lovely; but don’t be guided
wholly by that.”</p>

<p>“No. I suppose you are right,” sighed Tavia.</p>

<p>She shook her head at the clerk and prepared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
to follow her friend, who had already left the
counter. Hastily picking up what she supposed
to be her bag, Tavia ran two or three steps to
catch up with Dorothy. As she did so a feminine
shriek behind her startled everybody within hearing.</p>

<p>“That girl—she’s got my bag! Stop her!”</p>

<p>“Oh! what is it?” gasped Dorothy, turning.</p>

<p>“Somebody’s stolen something,” stammered
Tavia, turning around too.</p>

<p>Then she looked at the bag in her hand. Instead
of her own seal-leather one, it was a much
more expensive bag, gold mounted and plethoric.</p>

<p>“There she is! She’s got it in her hand!”</p>

<p>A woman dressed in the most extreme fashion
and most expensively, darted down the aisle upon
the two girls. She pointed a quivering, accusing
finger directly at poor Tavia.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br>
<span class="fs80">G. K. TO THE RESCUE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Dorothy Dale and her friend Tavia Travers
had often experienced very serious adventures,
but the shock of this incident perhaps was as great
and as thrilling as anything that had heretofore
happened to them.</p>

<p>The series of eleven previous stories about
Dorothy, Tavia, and their friends began with
“Dorothy Dale: A Girl of To-day,” some years
before the date of this present narrative. At that
time Dorothy was living with her father, Major
Frank Dale, a Civil War veteran, who owned and
edited the <em>Bugle</em>, a newspaper published in Dalton,
a small town in New York State.</p>

<p>Then Major Dale’s livelihood and that of the
family, consisting of Dorothy and her small brothers,
Joe and Roger, depended upon the success of
the <em>Bugle</em>. Taken seriously ill in the midst of a
lively campaign for temperance and for a general
reform government in Dalton, it looked as though
the major would lose his paper and the better element
in the town lose their fight for prohibition;
but Dorothy Dale, confident that she could do it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
got out the <em>Bugle</em> and did much, young girl though
she was, to save the day. In this she was helped
by Tavia Travers, a girl brought up entirely differently
from Dorothy, and who possessed exactly
the opposite characteristics to serve as a foil for
Dorothy’s own good sense and practical nature.</p>

<p>Major Dale was unexpectedly blessed with a
considerable legacy which enabled him to sell the
<em>Bugle</em> and take his children to The Cedars, at
North Birchland, to live with his widowed sister
and her two boys, Ned and Nat White, who were
both older than their cousin Dorothy. In “Dorothy
Dale at Glenwood School,” is related these
changes for the better in the fortunes of the Dale
family, and as well there is narrated the beginning
of a series of adventures at school and during
vacation times, in which Dorothy and Tavia are
the central characters.</p>

<p>Subsequent books are entitled respectively:
“Dorothy Dale’s Great Secret,” “Dorothy Dale
and Her Chums,” “Dorothy Dale’s Queer Holidays,”
“Dorothy Dale’s Camping Days,” “Dorothy
Dale’s School Rivals,” “Dorothy Dale in the
City,” and “Dorothy Dale’s Promise,” in which
story the two friends graduate from Glenwood
and return to their homes feeling—and looking,
of course—like real, grown-up young ladies.
Nevertheless, they are not then through with adventures,
surprising happenings, and much fun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>About the time the girls graduated from school
an old friend of Major Dale, Colonel Hardin,
passed away, leaving his large estate in the West
partly to the major and partly to be administered
for the local public good. Cattle raising was not
so generally followed as formerly in that section
and dry farming was being tried.</p>

<p>Colonel Hardin had foreseen that nothing but
a system of irrigation would save the poor farmers
from ruin and on his land was the fountain
of supply that should water the whole territory
about Desert City and make it “blossom as the
rose.” There were mining interests, however, selfishly
determined to obtain the water rights on the
Hardin Estate and that by hook or by crook.</p>

<p>Major Dale’s health was not at this time good
enough for him to look into these matters actively
or to administer his dead friend’s estate. Therefore,
it is told in “Dorothy Dale in the West,”
how Aunt Winnie White, Dorothy’s two cousins,
Ned and Nat, and herself with Tavia, go far
from North Birchland and mingle with the miners,
and other Western characters to be found on and
about the Hardin property, including a cowboy
named Lance Petterby, who shows unmistakable
signs of being devoted to Tavia. Indeed, after
the party return to the East, Lance writes to
Tavia and the latter’s apparent predilection for
the cowboy somewhat troubles Dorothy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>However, after their return to the East the
chums went for a long visit to the home of a
school friend, Jennie Hapgood, in Pennsylvania;
and there Tavia seemed to have secured other—and
less dangerous—interests. In “Dorothy
Dale’s Strange Discovery,” the narrative immediately
preceding this present tale, Dorothy displays
her characteristic kindliness and acute reasoning
powers in solving a problem that brings to
Jennie Hapgood’s father the very best of good
fortune.</p>

<p>Naturally, the Hapgoods are devoted to Dorothy.
Besides, Ned and Nat, her cousins, have
visited Sunnyside and are vastly interested in Jennie.
The girl chums now in New York City on
this shopping tour, expect on returning to North
Birchland to find Jennie Hapgood there for a
promised visit.</p>

<p>At the moment, however, that we find Dorothy
and Tavia at the beginning of this chapter, neither
girl is thinking much about Jennie Hapgood and
her expected visit, or of anything else of minor
importance.</p>

<p>The flashily dressed woman who had run after
Tavia down the aisle, again screamed her accusation
at the amazed and troubled girl:</p>

<p>“That’s my bag! It’s cram full of money, too.”</p>

<p>There was no great crowd in the store, for New
York ladies do not as a rule shop much before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
luncheon. Nevertheless, besides salespeople, there
were plenty to hear the woman’s unkind accusation
and enough curious shoppers to ring in immediately
the two troubled girls and the angry
woman.</p>

<p>“Give me it!” exclaimed the latter, and
snatched the bag out of Tavia’s hand. As this
was done the catch slipped in some way and the
handbag burst open.</p>

<p>It was “cram full” of money. Bills of large
denomination were rolled carelessly into a ball,
with a handkerchief, a purse for change, several
keys, and a vanity box. Some of these things
tumbled out upon the floor and a young boy
stooped and recovered them for her.</p>

<p>“You’re a bad, bad girl!” declared the angry
woman. “I hope they send you to jail.”</p>

<p>“Why—why, I didn’t know it was yours,” murmured
Tavia, quite upset.</p>

<p>“Oh! you thought somebody had forgotten it
and you could get away with it,” declared the
other, coarsely enough.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Madam,” Dorothy Dale
here interposed. “It was a mistake on my friend’s
part. And <em>you</em> are making another mistake, and
a serious one.”</p>

<p>She spoke in her most dignified tone, and although
Dorothy was barely in her twentieth year
she had the manner and stability of one much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
older. She realized that poor Tavia was in danger
of “going all to pieces” if the strain continued.
And, too, her own anger at the woman’s harsh
accusation naturally put the girl on her mettle.</p>

<p>“Who are <em>you</em>, I’d like to know?” snapped the
woman.</p>

<p>“I am her friend,” said Dorothy Dale, quite
composedly, “and I know her to be incapable of
taking your bag save by chance. She laid her own
down on the counter and took up yours——”</p>

<p>“And where <em>is</em> mine?” suddenly wailed Tavia,
on the verge of an hysterical outbreak. “My bag!
My money——”</p>

<p>“Hush!” whispered Dorothy in her friend’s
pretty ear. “Don’t become a second harridan—like
this creature.”</p>

<p>The woman had led the way back to the silk
counter. Tavia began to claw wildly among the
broken bolts of silk that the clerk had not yet been
able to return to the shelves. But she stopped at
Dorothy’s command, and stood, pale and trembling.</p>

<p>A floorwalker hastened forward. He evidently
knew the noisy woman as a good customer of the
store.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Halbridge! What is the matter? Nothing
serious, I hope?”</p>

<p>“It would have been serious all right,” said
the customer, in her high-pitched voice, “if I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
hadn’t just seen that girl by luck. Yes, by luck!
There she was making for the door with this bag
of mine—and there’s several hundred dollars in
it, I’d have you know.”</p>

<p>“I beg of you, Mrs. Halbridge,” said the floorwalker
in a low tone, “for the sake of the store
to make no trouble about it here. If you insist
we will take the girl up to the superintendent’s
office——”</p>

<p>Here Dorothy, her anger rising interrupted:</p>

<p>“You would better not. Mrs. Winthrop White,
of North Birchland, is a charge customer of your
store, and is probably just as well known to the
heads of the firm as this—this person,” and she
cast what Tavia—in another mood—would have
called a “scathing glance” at Mrs. Halbridge.</p>

<p>“I am Mrs. White’s niece and this is my particular
friend. We are here alone on a shopping
tour; but if our word is not quite as good as that
of this—this person, we certainly shall buy elsewhere.”</p>

<p>Tavia, obsessed with a single idea, murmured
again:</p>

<p>“But I haven’t got my bag! Somebody’s taken
my bag! And all my money——”</p>

<p>The floorwalker was glancing about, hoping for
some avenue of escape from the unfortunate predicament,
when a very tall, white-haired and soldierly
looking man appeared in the aisle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>“Mr. Schuman!” gasped the floorwalker.</p>

<p>The man was one of the chief proprietors of
the big store. He scowled slightly at the floorwalker
when he saw the excited crowd, and then
raised his eyebrows questioningly.</p>

<p>“This is not the place for any lengthy discussion,
Mr. Mink,” said Mr. Schuman, with just
the proper touch of admonition in his tone.</p>

<p>“I know! I know, Mr. Schuman!” said the
floorwalker. “But this difficulty—it came so suddenly—Mrs.
Halbridge, here, makes the complaint,”
he finally blurted out, in an attempt to
shoulder off some of the responsibility for the
unfortunate situation.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Halbridge?” The old gentleman bowed
in a most courtly style. “One of our customers,
I presume, Mr. Mink?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, indeed, Mr. Schuman,” the floorwalker
hastened to say. “One of our <em>very</em> good
customers. And I am so sorry that anything
should have happened——”</p>

<p>“But what has happened?” asked Mr. Schuman,
sharply.</p>

<p>“She—she accuses this—it’s all a mistake, I’m
sure—this young lady of taking her bag,” stuttered
Mr. Mink, pointing to Tavia.</p>

<p>“She ought to be arrested,” muttered the excited
Mrs. Halbridge.</p>

<p>“What? But this is a matter for the superintendent’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
office, Mr. Mink,” returned Mr. Schuman.</p>

<p>“Oh!” stammered the floorwalker. “The bag
is returned.”</p>

<p>“And now,” put in Dorothy Dale, haughtily,
and looking straight and unflinchingly into the
keen eyes of Mr. Schuman, “my friend wishes to
know what has become of <em>her</em> bag?”</p>

<p>Mr. Schuman looked at the two girls with momentary
hesitation.</p>

<p>There was something compelling in the ladylike
look and behaviour of these two girls—and
especially in Dorothy’s speech. At the moment,
too, a hand was laid tentatively upon Mr. Schuman’s
arm.</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, sir,” said the full, resonant voice
that Dorothy had noted the day before. “I know
the young ladies—Miss Dale and Miss Travers,
respectively, Mr. Schuman.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Knapp—thank you!” said the old
gentleman, turning to the tall young Westerner
with whom he had been walking through the store
at the moment he had spied the crowd. “You are
a discourager of embarrassment.”</p>

<p>“Oh! blessed ‘G. K.’!” whispered Tavia,
weakly clinging to Dorothy’s arm.</p>

<span class="fs80">TAVIA IN THE SHADE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Halbridge was slyly slipping through
the crowd. She had suddenly lost all interest in
the punishment of the girl she had accused of
stealing her bag and her money.</p>

<p>There was something so stern about Mr. Schuman
that it was not strange that the excitable
woman should fear further discussion of the matter.
The old gentleman turned at once to Dorothy
Dale and Tavia Travers.</p>

<p>“This is an unfortunate and regrettable incident,
young ladies,” he said suavely. “I assure
you that such things as this seldom occur under
our roof.”</p>

<p>“I am confident it is a single occurrence,” Dorothy
said, with conviction, “or my aunt, Mrs. Winthrop
White, of North Birchland, would not have
traded with you for so many years.”</p>

<p>“One of our charge customers, Mr. Schuman,”
whispered Mr. Mink, deciding it was quite time
now to come to the assistance of the girls.</p>

<p>“Regrettable! Regrettable!” repeated the old
gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>Here Tavia again entered her wailing protest:</p>

<p>“I did not mean to take her bag from the counter.
But somebody has taken my bag.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tavia!” exclaimed her friend, now
startled into noticing what Tavia really said about
it.</p>

<p>“It’s gone!” wailed Tavia. “And all the money
father sent me. Oh, dear, Doro Dale! I guess
I <em>have</em> thrown my money away, and, as you prophesied,
it isn’t as much fun as I thought it might
be.”</p>

<p>“My dear young lady,” hastily inquired Mr.
Schuman, “have you really lost your purse?”</p>

<p>“My bag,” sobbed Tavia. “I laid it down while
I examined some silk. That clerk saw me,” she
added, pointing to the man behind the counter.</p>

<p>“It is true, Mr. Schuman,” the silk clerk admitted,
blushing painfully. “But, of course, I did
not notice what became of the lady’s bag.”</p>

<p>“Nor did I see the other bag until I found it
in my hand,” Tavia cried.</p>

<p>The crowd was dissipated by this time, and all
spoke in low voices. Outside the counter was a
cash-girl, a big-eyed and big-eared little thing, who
was evidently listening curiously to the conversation.
Mr. Mink said sharply to her:</p>

<p>“Number forty-seven! do you know anything
about this bag business?”</p>

<p>“No—no, sir!” gasped the frightened girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>“Then go on about your business,” the floorwalker
said, waving her away in his most lordly
manner.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Dorothy had obtained a word with
the young Mr. Knapp who had done her and
Tavia such a kindness.</p>

<p>“Thank you a thousand times, Mr. Knapp,”
she whispered, her eyes shining gratefully into his.
“It might have been awkward for us without you.
And,” she added, pointedly, “how fortunate you
knew our names!”</p>

<p>He was smiling broadly, but she saw the color
rise in his bronzed cheeks at her last remark. She
liked him all the better for blushing so boyishly.</p>

<p>“Got me there, Miss Dale,” he blurted out. “I
was curious, and I looked on the hotel register to
see your names after the clerk brought it back
from the parlor where he went to greet you yesterday.
Hope you’ll forgive me for being so—er—rubbery.”</p>

<p>“It proves to be a very fortunate curiosity on
your part,” she told him, smiling.</p>

<p>“Say!” he whispered, “your friend is all broken
up over this. Has she lost much?”</p>

<p>“All the money she had to pay for the clothes
she wished to buy, I’m afraid,” sighed Dorothy.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s get her out of here—go somewhere
to recuperate. There’s a good hotel across the
street. I had my breakfast there before I began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
to shop,” and he laughed. “A cup of tea will revive
her, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“And you are suffering for a cup, too, I am
sure,” Dorothy told him, her eyes betraying her
amusement, at his rather awkward attempt to become
friendly with Tavia and herself.</p>

<p>But Dorothy approved of this young man.
Aside from the assistance he had undoubtedly
rendered her chum and herself, G. Knapp seemed
to be far above the average young man.</p>

<p>She turned now quickly to Tavia. Mr. Schuman
was saying very kindly:</p>

<p>“Search shall be made, my dear young lady.
I am exceedingly sorry that such a thing should
happen in our store. Of course, somebody picked
up your bag before you inadvertently took the
other lady’s. If I had my way I would have it a
law that every shopper should have her purse riveted
to her wrist with a chain.”</p>

<p>It was no laughing matter, however, for poor
Tavia. Her family was not in the easy circumstances
that Dorothy’s was. Indeed, Mr. Travers
was only fairly well-to-do, and Tavia’s mother
was exceedingly extravagant. It was difficult
sometimes for Tavia to obtain sufficient money
to get along with.</p>

<p>Besides, she was incautious herself. It was
natural for her to be wasteful and thoughtless.
But this was the first time in her experience that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
she had either wasted or lost such a sum of
money.</p>

<p>She wiped her eyes very quickly when Dorothy
whispered to her that they were going out for a
cup of tea with Mr. Knapp.</p>

<p>“Oh dear, that perfectly splendid cowboy person!”
groaned Tavia. “And I am in no mood to
make an impression. Doro! you’ll have to do it
all yourself this time. Do keep him in play until
I recover from, this blow—if I ever do.”</p>

<p>The young man, who led the way to the side
door of the store which was opposite the hotel
and restaurant of which he had spoken, heard
the last few words and turned to ask seriously:</p>

<p>“Surely Miss Travers did not lose <em>all</em> the money
she had?”</p>

<p>“All I had in the world!” wailed Tavia. “Except
a lonely little five dollar bill.”</p>

<p>“Where is that?” asked Dorothy, in surprise.</p>

<p>“In the First National Bank,” Tavia said demurely.</p>

<p>“Oh, then, <em>that’s</em> safe enough,” said Mr.
Knapp.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you had even that much in the
bank,” remarked Dorothy, doubtfully. “The
First National?”</p>

<p>“Yep!” declared Tavia promptly, but nudged
her friend. “Hush!” she hissed.</p>

<p>Dorothy did not understand, but she saw there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
was something queer about this statement. It was
news to her that her chum ever thought of putting
a penny on deposit in any bank. It was not
like Tavia.</p>

<p>“How do you feel now, dear?” she asked the
unfortunate girl, as they stepped out into the open
air behind the broad-shouldered young Westerner,
who held the door open for their passage.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me!” sighed Tavia. “I’m forty degrees
in the shade—and the temperature is still
going down. What ever <em>shall</em> I do? I’ll be positively
naked before Thanksgiving!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br>
<span class="fs80">SOMETHING ABOUT “G. KNAPP”</span></h2>
</div>

<p>But how can three people with all the revivifying
flow of youth in their veins remain in the
dumps, to use one of Tavia’s own illuminating expressions.
Impossible! That tea at the Holyoke
House, which began so miserably, scaled upward
like the notes of a coloratura soprano until they
were all three chatting and laughing like old
friends. Even Tavia had to forget her miserable
financial state.</p>

<p>Dorothy believed her first impression of G.
Knapp had not been wrong. Indeed, he improved
with every moment of increasing familiarity.</p>

<p>In the first place, although his repartee was
bright enough, and he was very jolly and frank,
he had eyes and attention for somebody besides
the chatterbox, Tavia. Perhaps right at first
Tavia was a little under the mark, her mind naturally
being upon her troubles; but with a strange
young man before her the gay and sparkling Tavia
would soon be inspired.</p>

<p>However, for once she did not absorb all the
more or less helpless male’s attention. G. Knapp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
insisted upon dividing equally his glances, his
speeches, and his smiles between the two young
ladies.</p>

<p>They discovered that his full and proper name
was Garford Knapp—the first, of course, shortened
to “Garry.” He was of the West, Western,
without a doubt. He had secured a degree
at a Western university, although both before and
after his scholastic course he had, as Tavia in
the beginning suggested, been a “cowboy person.”</p>

<p>“And it looks as if I’d be punching cows and
doing other chores for Bob Douglas, who owns
the Four-Square ranch, for the rest of my natural,”
was one thing Garry Knapp told the girls,
and told them cheerfully. “I did count on falling
heir to a piece of money when Uncle Terrence
cashed in. But not—no more!”</p>

<p>“Why is that?” Dorothy asked, seeing that the
young man was serious despite his somewhat careless
way of speaking.</p>

<p>“The old codger is just like tinder,” laughed
Garry. “Lights up if a spark gets to him. And
I unfortunately and unintentionally applied the
spark. He’s gone off to Alaska mad as a hatter
and left me in the lurch. And we were chums
when I was a kid and until I came back from college.”</p>

<p>“You mean you have quarreled with your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
uncle?” Dorothy queried, with some seriousness.</p>

<p>“Not at all, Miss Dale,” he declared, promptly.
“The old fellow quarreled with me. They say it
takes two to make a quarrel. That’s not always
so. One can do it just as <em>e-easy</em>. At least, one
like Uncle Terrence can. He had red hair when
he was young, and he has a strong fighting Irish
strain in him. The row began over nothing and
ended with his lighting out between evening and
sunrise and leaving me flat.</p>

<p>“Of course, I broke into a job with Bob Douglas
right away——”</p>

<p>“Do you mean, Mr. Knapp, that your uncle
went away and left you without money?” Dorothy
asked.</p>

<p>“Only what I chanced to have in my pocket,”
Garry Knapp said cheerfully. “He’d always been
mighty good to me. Put me through school and
all that. All I have is a piece of land—and a
good big piece—outside of Desert City; but it
isn’t worth much. Cattle raising is petering out
in that region. Last year the mouth and hoof disease
just about ruined the man that grazed my
land. His cattle died like flies.</p>

<p>“Then, the land was badly grazed by sheepmen
for years. Sheep about poison land for anything
else to live on,” he added, with a cattleman’s
usual disgust at the thought of “mutton on
the hoof.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>“One thing I’ve come East for, Miss Dale, is
to sell that land. Got a sort of tentative offer by
mail. Bob wanted a lot of stuff for the ranch and
for his family and couldn’t come himself. So I
combined his business and mine and hope to make
a sale of the land my father left me before I go
back.</p>

<p>“Then, with that nest-egg, I’ll try to break into
some game that will offer a man-sized profit,” and
Garry Knapp laughed again in his mellow, whole-souled
way.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he just a <em>dear</em>?” whispered Tavia as
Garry turned to speak to the waiter. “Don’t you
love to hear him talk?”</p>

<p>“And have you never heard from your old
uncle who went away and left you?” Dorothy
asked.</p>

<p>“Not a word. He’s too mad to speak, let
alone write,” and a cloud for a moment crossed
the open, handsome face of the Westerner. “But
I know where he is, and every once in a while
somebody writes me telling me Uncle Terry is all
right.”</p>

<p>“But, an old man, away up there in
Alaska——?”</p>

<p>“Bless you, Miss Dale,” chuckled Garry
Knapp. “That dear old codger has been knocking
about in rough country all his days. He’s
always been a miner. Prospected pretty well all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
over our West. He’s made, and then bunted
away, big fortunes sometimes.</p>

<p>“He always has a stake laid down somewhere.
Never gets real poor, and never went hungry in
his life—unless he chanced to run out of grub on
some prospecting tour, or his gun was broken and
he couldn’t shoot a jackrabbit for a stew.</p>

<p>“Oh, Uncle Terrence isn’t at all the sort of
hampered prospector you read about in the books.
He doesn’t go mooning around, expecting to
‘strike it rich’ and running the risk of leaving his
bones in the desert.</p>

<p>“No, Uncle Terry is likely to make another
fortune before he dies——”</p>

<p>“Oh! Then maybe you will be rich!” cried
Tavia, breaking in.</p>

<p>“No.” Garry shook his head with a quizzical
smile on his lips and in his eyes. “No. He vowed
I should never see the color of his money. First,
he said, he’d leave it to found a home for indignant
rattlesnakes. And he’d surely have plenty
of inmates, for rattlers seem always to be indignant,”
he added with a chuckle.</p>

<p>Dorothy wanted awfully to ask him why he
had quarreled with his uncle—or <em>vice versa</em>; but
that would have been too personal upon first meeting.
She liked the young man more and more;
and in spite of Tavia’s loss they parted at the end
of the hour in great good spirits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>“I’m going to be just as busy as I can be this
afternoon,” Garry Knapp announced, as they went
out. “But I shall get back to the hotel to supper.
I wasn’t in last night when you ladies were
down. May I eat at your table?” and his eyes
squinted up again in that droll way Dorothy had
come to look for.</p>

<p>“How do you know we ate in the hotel last
evening?” demanded Tavia, promptly.</p>

<p>“Asked the head waiter,” replied Garry Knapp,
unabashed.</p>

<p>“If you are so much interested in whether we
take proper nourishment or not, you had better
join us at dinner,” Dorothy said, laughing.</p>

<p>“It’s a bet!” declared the young Westerner,
and lifting his broad-brimmed hat he left the girls
upon the sidewalk outside the restaurant.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he the very nicest—but, oh, Doro! what
shall I do?” exclaimed the miserable Tavia. “All
my money——”</p>

<p>“Let’s go back and see if it’s been found.”</p>

<p>“Oh, not a chance!” gasped Tavia. “That horrid
woman——”</p>

<p>“I scarcely believe that we can lay it to Mrs.
Halbridge’s door in any particular,” said Dorothy,
gravely. “You should not have left your bag
on the counter.”</p>

<p>“She laid hers there! And, oh, Doro! it was
full of money,” sighed her friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>“Probably your bag had been taken before you
even touched hers.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! why did it have to happen to <em>me</em>—and
at just this time. When I need things so much.
Not a thing to wear! And it’s going to be a cold,
cold winter, too!”</p>

<p>Tavia would joke “if the heavens fell”—that
was her nature. But that she was seriously embarrassed
for funds Dorothy Dale knew right
well.</p>

<p>“If it had only been your bag that was lost,”
wailed Tavia, “you would telegraph to Aunt Winnie
and get more money!”</p>

<p>“And I shall do that in this case,” said her
friend, placidly.</p>

<p>“Oh! no you won’t!” cried Tavia, suddenly. “I
will not take another cent from your Aunt Winnie
White—who’s the most blessed, generous,
free, open-handed person who ever——”</p>

<p>“Goodness! no further attributes?” laughed
Dorothy.</p>

<p>“No, Doro,” Tavia said, suddenly serious. “I
have done this thing myself. It is <em>awful</em>. Poor
old daddy earns his money too hardly for <em>me</em> to
throw it away. I should know better. I should
have learned caution and economy by this time
with you, my dear, as an example ever before me.</p>

<p>“Poor mother wastes money because she
doesn’t <em>know</em>. I have had every advantage of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
bright and shining example,” and she pinched
Dorothy’s arm as they entered the big store
again. “If I have lost my money, I’ve lost it, and
that’s the end of it. No new clothes for little
Tavia—and serves her right!” she finished, bitterly.</p>

<p>Dorothy well knew that this was a tragic happening
for her friend. Generously she would have
sent for more money, or divided her own store
with Tavia. But she knew her chum to be in
earnest, and she approved.</p>

<p>It was not as though Tavia had nothing to
wear. She had a full and complete wardrobe, only
it would be no longer up to date. And she would
have to curtail much of the fun the girls had
looked forward to on this, their first trip, unchaperoned,
to the great city.</p>

</div>

<p>Nothing, of course, had been seen or heard
of Tavia’s bag. Mr. Schuman himself had made
the investigation, and he came to the girls personally
to tell them how extremely sorry he was.
But being sorry did not help.</p>

<p>“I’m done for!” groaned Tavia, as they returned
to their rooms at the hotel just before
luncheon. “I can’t even buy a stick of peppermint
candy to send to the kids at Dalton.”</p>

<p>“How about that five dollars in the bank?”
asked Dorothy, suddenly remembering Tavia’s
previous and most surprising statement. “And
how did you ever come to have a bank account?
Is it in the First National of Dalton?”</p>

<p>There was a laugh from Tavia, a sudden flash
of lingerie and the display of a silk stocking.
Then she held out to her chum a neatly folded
banknote wrapped in tissue paper.</p>

<p>“First National Bank of Womankind,” she
cried gaily. “I always carry it there in case of
accident—being run over, robbed, or an earthquake.
But that five dollars is all I own. Oh,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>dear! I wish I had stuffed the whole roll into
my stocking.”</p>

<p>“Don’t, Tavia! it’s not ladylike.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care. Pockets are out of style again,”
pouted her friend. “And, anyway, you must admit
that <em>this</em> was a stroke of genius, for I would
otherwise be without a penny.”</p>

<p>However, Tavia was too kind-hearted, as well
as light-hearted, to allow her loss to cloud the day
for Dorothy. She was just as enthusiastic in the
afternoon in helping her friend select the goods
she wished to buy as though all the “pretties” were
for herself.</p>

<p>They came home toward dusk, tired enough,
and lay down for an hour—“relaxing as per instructions
of Lovely Lucy Larriper, the afternoon
newspaper statistician,” Tavia said.</p>

<p>“Why ‘statistician’?” asked Dorothy, wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Why! isn’t she a ‘figger’ expert?” laughed
Tavia. “Now relax!”</p>

<p>A brisk bath followed and then, at seven, the
two girls stepped out of the elevator into the
lobby of the hotel and found Garry Knapp waiting
for them. He was likewise well tubbed and
scrubbed, but he did not conform to city custom
and wear evening dress. Indeed, Dorothy could
not imagine him in the black and severe habiliments
of society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>“Not that his figure would not carry them
well,” she thought. “But he would somehow
seem out of place. Some of his breeziness and—and—yes!—his
<em>nice</em> kind of ‘freshness’ would be
gone. That gray business suit becomes him and
so does his hat.”</p>

<p>But, of course, the hat was not in evidence at
present. The captain of the waiters had evidently
expected this party, for he beckoned them to a
retired table the moment the trio entered the long
dining-room.</p>

<p>“How cozy!” exclaimed Dorothy. “You must
have what they call a ‘pull’ with people in authority,
Mr. Knapp.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Why, you can get the best table in the dining-room,
and this morning you rescued us from
trouble through your acquaintanceship with Mr.
Schuman.”</p>

<p>“The influence of the Almighty Dollar,” said
Garry Knapp, briefly. “This morning I had just
spent several hundred dollars of Bob Douglass’
good money in that store. And here at this
hotel Bob’s name is as good as a gold certificate.”</p>

<p>“Oh, money! money!” groaned Tavia, “what
crimes are committed in thy name—and likewise,
what benefits achieved! I wonder what the person
who stole it is doing with <em>my</em> money?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it was somebody who needed it more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
than you do,” said Dorothy, rather quizzically.</p>

<p>“Can’t be such a person. And needy people
seldom find money. Besides, needy folk are always
honest—in the books. I’m honest myself,
and heaven knows I’m needy!”</p>

<p>“Was it truly all the money you had with you?”
asked Garry Knapp, commiseratingly.</p>

<p>“Honest and true, black and blue, lay me down
and cut me in two!” chanted Tavia.</p>

<p>“All but the five dollars in the bank,” Dorothy
said demurely, but with dancing eyes.</p>

<p>And for once Tavia actually blushed and was
silenced—for a moment. Garry drawled:</p>

<p>“I wonder who did get your bag, Miss Travers?
Of course, there are always light-fingered
people hanging about a store like that.”</p>

<p>“And the money will be put to no good use,”
declared the loser, dejectedly. “If the person finding
it would only found a hospital—or something—with
it, I’d feel a lot better. But I know just
what will happen.”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>“The person who took my bag will go and
blow themselves to a fancy dinner—oh! better
even than <em>this</em> one. I only hope he or she will eat
so much that they will be sick——”</p>

<p>“Don’t! don’t!” begged Dorothy, stopping her
ears. “You are dreadfully mixed in your grammar.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>“Do you wonder? After having been robbed so
ruthlessly?”</p>

<p>“But, certainly, dear,” cooed Dorothy, “your
knowledge of grammar was not in your bag, too?”</p>

<p>Thus they joked over Tavia’s tragedy; but all
the time Dorothy’s agile mind was working hard
to scheme out a way to help her chum over this
very, very hard place.</p>

<p>Just at this time, however, she had to give some
thought to Garry Knapp. He took out three slips
of pasteboard toward the end of the very pleasant
meal and flipped them upon the cloth.</p>

<p>“I took a chance,” he said, in his boyish way.
“There’s a good show down the street—kill a little
time. Vaudeville and pictures. Good seats.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s!” cried Tavia, clasping her hands.</p>

<p>Dorothy knew that the theatre in question was
respectable enough, although the entertainment
was not of the Broadway class. But she knew,
too, that this young man from the West probably
could not afford to pay two dollars or more for
a seat for an evening’s pleasure.</p>

<p>“Of course we’ll be delighted to go. And we’d
better go at once,” Dorothy said, without hesitation.
“I’m ready. Are you, Tavia?”</p>

<p>“You dear!” whispered Tavia, squeezing her
arm as they followed Garry Knapp from the dining-room.
“I never before knew you to be so
amenable where a young man was concerned.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>“Is that so?” drawled Dorothy, but hid her
face from her friend’s sharp eyes.</p>

<p>It was late, but a fine, bright, dry evening when
the trio came out of the theatre and walked slowly
toward their hotel. On the block in the middle
of which the Fanuel was situated there were but
few pedestrians. As they approached the main
entrance to the hotel a girl came slowly toward
them, peering, it seemed, sharply into their faces.</p>

<p>She was rather shabbily dressed, but was not
at all an unattractive looking girl. Dorothy noticed
that her passing glance was for Garry Knapp,
not for herself or for Tavia. The young man
had half dropped behind as they approached the
hotel entrance and was saying:</p>

<p>“I think I’ll take a brisk walk for a bit, having
seen you ladies home after a very charming evening.
I feel kind of shut in after that theatre, and
want to expand my lungs.”</p>

<p>“Good-night, then, Mr. Knapp,” Dorothy said
lightly. “And thank you for a pleasant evening.”</p>

<p>“Ditto!” Tavia said, hiding a little yawn behind
her gloved fingers.</p>

<p>The girls stepped toward the open door of the
hotel. Garry Knapp wheeled and started back
the way they had come. Tavia clutched her
chum’s arm with excitement.</p>

<p>“Did you see that girl?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>“Why—yes,” Dorothy said wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Look back! Quick!”</p>

<p>Impelled by her chum’s tone, Dorothy turned
and looked up the street. Garry Knapp had overtaken
the girl. The girl looked sidewise at him—they
could see her turn her head—and then she
evidently spoke. Garry dropped into slow step
with her, and they strolled along, talking eagerly.</p>

<p>“Why, he must know her!” gasped Tavia.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t he introduce her then?” Dorothy
said shortly. “It serves me right.”</p>

<p>“What serves you right?”</p>

<p>“For allowing you, as well as myself, to become
so familiar with a strange man.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” murmured Tavia, slowly. “It’s not so
bad as all <em>that</em>. You’re making a mountain out
of a molehill.”</p>

<p>But Dorothy would not listen.</p>

<span class="fs80">SOMETHING OF A MYSTERY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Tavia slept her usually sweet, sound sleep that
night, despite the strange surroundings of the hotel
and the happenings of a busy day; but Dorothy
lay for a long time, unable to close her eyes.</p>

<p>In the morning, however, she was as deep in
slumber as ever her chum was when a knock came
on the door of their anteroom. Both girls sat up
and said in chorus:</p>

<p>“Who’s there?”</p>

<p>“It’s jes’ me, Missy,” said the soft voice of the
colored maid. “Did one o’ youse young ladies
lost somethin’?”</p>

<p>“Oh, mercy me, yes!” shouted Tavia, jumping
completely out of her bed and running toward the
door.</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Tavia!” admonished Dorothy, likewise
hopping out of bed. “She can’t have found
your money.”</p>

<p>“Oh! what is it, please?” asked Tavia, opening
the door just a trifle.</p>

<p>“Has you lost somethin’?” repeated the colored
girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>“I lost my handbag in a store yesterday,” said
Tavia.</p>

<p>“Das it, Missy,” chuckled the maid. “De clark,
he axed me to ax yo’ ’bout it. It’s done come
back.”</p>

<p>“What’s come back?” demanded Dorothy, likewise
appearing at the door and in the same dishabille
as her friend.</p>

<p>“De bag. De clark tol’ me to tell yo’ ladies dat
all de money is safe in it, too. Now yo’ kin go
back to sleep again. He’s done got de bag in he’s
safe;” and the girl went away chuckling.</p>

<p>Tavia fell up against the door and stared at
Dorothy.</p>

<p>“Oh, Doro! Can it be?” she panted.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tavia! What luck!”</p>

<p>“There’s the telephone! I’m going to call up
the office,” and Tavia darted for the instrument
on the wall.</p>

<p>But there was something the matter with the
wires; that was why the clerk had sent the maid
to the room.</p>

<p>“Then I’m going to dress and go right down
and see about it,” Tavia said.</p>

<p>“But it’s only six o’clock,” yawned Dorothy.
“The maid was right. We should go back to
bed.”</p>

<p>Her friend scorned the suggestion and she
fairly “hopped” into her clothes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>“Be sure and powder your nose, dear,”
laughed Dorothy. “But I <em>am</em> glad for you,
Tavia.”</p>

<p>“Bother my nose!” responded her friend, running
out of her room and into the corridor.</p>

<p>She whisked back again before Dorothy was
more than half dressed with the precious bag in
her hands.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is! it is!” she cried, whirling about
Dorothy’s room and her own and the bath and
anteroom, in a dervish dance of joy. “Doro!
Doro! I’m saved!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether you are saved or not,
dear. But you plainly are delighted.”</p>

<p>“Every penny safe.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. I counted. I had to sign a receipt
for the clerk, too. He is the <em>dearest</em> man.”</p>

<p>“Well, dear, I hope this will be a lesson to
you,” Dorothy said.</p>

<p>“It will be!” declared the excited Tavia. “Do
you know what I am going to do?”</p>

<p>“Spend your money more recklessly than ever,
I suppose,” sighed her friend.</p>

<p>“Say! seems to me you’re awfully glum this
morning. You’re not nice about my good luck—not
a bit,” and Tavia stared at her in puzzlement.</p>

<p>“Of course I’m delighted that you should recover<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
your bag,” Dorothy hastened to say. “How
did it come back?”</p>

<p>“Why, the clerk gave it to me, I tell you.”</p>

<p>“What clerk? The one at the silk counter?”</p>

<p>“Goodness! The hotel clerk downstairs.”</p>

<p>“But how did <em>he</em> come by it?”</p>

<p>Tavia slowly sat down and blinked. “Why—why,”
she said, “I didn’t even think to ask him.”</p>

<p>“Well, Tavia!” exclaimed Dorothy, rather
aghast at this admission of her flyaway friend.</p>

<p>“I do seem to have been awfully thoughtless
again,” admitted Tavia, slowly. “I thanked him—the
clerk, I mean! Oh, I did! I could have
kissed him!”</p>

<p>“Tavia!”</p>

<p>“I could; but I didn’t,” said the wicked Tavia,
her eyes sparkling once more. “But I never
thought to ask how he came by it. Maybe some
poor person found it and should be rewarded.
Should I give a tithe of it, Doro, as a reward, as
we give a tithe to the church? Let’s see! I had
just eighty-nine dollars and thirty-seven cents, and
an old copper penny for a pocket-piece. One-tenth
of that would be——”</p>

<p>“Do be sensible!” exclaimed Dorothy, rather
tartly for her. “You might at least have asked
how the bag was sent here—whether by the store
itself, or by some employee, or brought by some
outside person.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>“Goodness! if it were your money would you
have been so curious?” demanded Tavia. “I
don’t believe it. You would have been just as
excited as I was.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” admitted Dorothy, after a moment.
“Anyway, I’m glad you have it back,
dear.”</p>

<p>“And do you know what I am going to do? I
am going to take that old man’s advice.”</p>

<p>“What old man, Tavia?”</p>

<p>“That Mr. Schuman—the head of the big
store. I am going to go out right after breakfast
and buy me a dog chain and chain that bag to my
wrist.”</p>

<p>Dorothy laughed at this—yet she did not laugh
happily. There was something wrong with her,
and as soon as Tavia began to quiet down a bit
she noticed it again.</p>

<p>“Doro,” she exclaimed, “I do believe something
has happened to you!”</p>

<p>“What something?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. But you are not—not happy.
What is it?”</p>

<p>“Hungry,” said Dorothy, shortly. “Do stop
primping now and come on down to breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Well, you must be savagely hungry then, if it
makes you like this,” grumbled Tavia. “And it
is an hour before our usual breakfast time.”</p>

<p>They went down in the elevator to the lower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
floor, Tavia carrying the precious bag. She would
not trust it out of her sight again, she said, as
long as a penny was left in it.</p>

<p>She attempted to go over to the clerk’s desk at
the far side of the lobby to ask for the details
of the recovery of her bag; but there were several
men at the desk and Dorothy stopped her.</p>

<p>“Wait until he is more at leisure,” she advised
Tavia. “And until there are not so many men
about.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense!” ejaculated Tavia, but she
turned to follow Dorothy. Then she added:
“Ah, there is one you won’t mind speaking
to——”</p>

<p>“Where?” cried Dorothy, stopping instantly.</p>

<p>“Going into the dining-room,” said Tavia.</p>

<p>Dorothy then saw the gray back of Garford
Knapp ahead of them. She turned swiftly for the
exit of the hotel.</p>

<p>“Come!” she said, “let’s get a breath of air before
breakfast. It—it will give us an appetite!”
And she fairly dragged Tavia to the sidewalk.</p>

<p>“Well, I declare to goodness!” volleyed Tavia,
staring at her. “And just now you were as hungry
as a bear. And you still seem to have a bear’s
nature. How rough! Don’t you want to see that
young man?”</p>

<p>“Never!” snapped Dorothy, and started
straight along toward the Hudson River.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>Tavia was for the moment silenced. But after
a bit she asked slyly:</p>

<p>“You’re not really going to walk clear home,
are you, dear? North Birchland is a long, long
walk—and the river intervenes.”</p>

<p>Dorothy had to laugh. But her face almost immediately
fell into very serious lines. Tavia, for
once, considered her chum’s feelings. She said
nothing regarding Garry Knapp.</p>

<p>“Well,” she murmured. “<em>I</em> need no appetite—no
more than I have. Aren’t you going to eat at
all this morning, Dorothy?”</p>

<p>“Here is a restaurant; let us go in,” said her
friend promptly.</p>

<p>They did so, and Dorothy lingered over the
meal (which was nowhere as good as that they
would have secured at the Fanuel) until she was
positive that Mr. Knapp must have finished his
own breakfast and left the hotel.</p>

<p>In fact, they saw him run out and catch a car
in front of the hotel entrance while they were still
some rods from the door. Dorothy at once became
brisker of movement, hurrying Tavia along.</p>

<p>“We must really shop to-day,” she said with
decision. “Not merely look and window-shop.”</p>

<p>“Surely,” agreed Tavia.</p>

<p>“And we’ll not come back to luncheon—it takes
too much time,” Dorothy went on, as they hurried
into the elevator. “Perhaps we can get tickets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
for that nice play Ned and Nat saw when they
were down here last time. Then, if we do, we will
stay uptown for dinner——”</p>

<p>“Mercy! All that time in the same clothes and
without the prescribed ‘relax’?” groaned Tavia.
“We’ll look as though we had been ground between
the upper and the nether millstone.”</p>

<p>“Well——”</p>

<p>They had reached their rooms. Tavia turned
upon her and suddenly seized Dorothy by both
shoulders, looking accusingly into her friend’s
eyes.</p>

<p>“I know what you are up to. You are running
away from that man.”</p>

<p>“Oh! What——”</p>

<p>“Never mind trying to dodge the issue,” said
Tavia, sternly. “That Garry Knapp. And it
seems he must be a pretty nappy sort, sure enough.
He probably knew that girl and was ashamed to
have us see him speaking to one so shabby. Now!
what do you care what he does?”</p>

<p>“I don’t,” denied Dorothy, hotly. “I’m only
ashamed that we have been seen with him. And
it is my fault.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know why?”</p>

<p>“It was unnecessary for us to have become so
friendly with him just because he did us a favor.”</p>

<p>“Yes—but——”</p>

<p>“It was I. I did it,” said Dorothy, almost in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
tears. “We should never allow ourselves to become
acquainted with strangers in any such way.
Now you see what it means, Tavia. It is not your
fault—it is mine. But it should teach you a lesson
as well as me.”</p>

<p>“Goodness!” said the startled Tavia. “I don’t
see that it is anything very terrible. The fellow
is really nothing to us.”</p>

<p>“But people having seen us with him—and then
seeing him with that common-acting girl——”</p>

<p>“Pooh! what do we care?” repeated Tavia.
“Garry Knapp is nothing to us, and never would
be.”</p>

<p>Dorothy said not another word, but turned
quickly away from her friend. She was very
quiet while they made ready for their shopping
trip, and Tavia could not arouse her.</p>

<p>Careless and unobservant as Tavia was, anything
seriously the matter with her chum always
influenced her. She gradually “simmered down”
herself, and when they started forth from their
rooms both girls were morose.</p>

<p>As they passed through the lobby a bellhop was
called to the desk, and then he charged after the
two girls.</p>

<p>“Please, Miss! Which is Miss Dale?” he
asked, looking at the letter in his hand.</p>

<p>Dorothy held out her hand and took it. It was
written on the hotel stationery, and the handwriting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
was strange to her. She tore it open at once.
She read the line or two of the note, and then
stopped, stunned.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Tavia, wonderingly.</p>

<p>Dorothy handed her the note. It was signed
“G. Knapp” and read as follows:</p>
<br>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent">
“Dear Miss Dale:<br>
</p>

<p>“Did your friend get her bag and money all
right?”</p>

<span class="fs80">GARRY SEES A WALL AHEAD</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Why, what under the sun! How did <em>he</em> come
to know about it?” demanded Tavia. “Goodness!”</p>

<p>“He—he maybe—had something to do with
recovering it for you,” Dorothy said faintly. Yet
in her heart she knew that it was hope that suggested
the idea, not reason.</p>

<p>“Well, I am going to find out right now,” declared
Tavia Travers, and she marched back to
the clerk’s desk before Dorothy could object,
had she desired to.</p>

<p>“This note to my friend is from Mr. Knapp,
who is stopping here,” Tavia said to the young
man behind the counter. “Did he have anything
to do with getting back my bag?”</p>

<p>“I know nothing about your bag, Miss,” said
the clerk. “I was not on duty, I presume, when
it was handed in. You are Miss——”</p>

<p>“Travers.”</p>

<p>The clerk went to the safe and found a memorandum,
which he read and then returned to the
desk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>“Your supposition is correct, Miss Travers.
Mr. Knapp handed in the handbag and took a
receipt for it.”</p>

<p>“When did he do that?” asked Tavia, quickly,
almost overpowered with amazement.</p>

<p>“Some time during the night. Before I came
on duty at seven o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Well! isn’t that the strangest thing?” Tavia
said to Dorothy, when she rejoined her friend at
the hotel entrance after thanking the clerk.</p>

<p>“How ever could he have got it in the night?”
murmured Dorothy.</p>

<p>“Say! he’s all right—Garry Knapp is!” Tavia
cried, shaking the bag to which she now clung so
tightly, and almost on the verge of doing a few
“steps of delight” on the public thoroughfare. “I
could hug him!”</p>

<p>“It—it is very strange,” murmured Dorothy,
for she was still very much disturbed in her mind.</p>

<p>“It’s particularly jolly,” said Tavia. “And I
am going to—well, thank him, at least,” as she
saw her friend start and glance at her admonishingly,
“just the very first chance I get. But I
ought to hug him! He deserves <em>some</em> reward.
You said yourself that perhaps I should
reward the finder.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Knapp could not possibly have been the
finder. The bag was merely returned through
him.” Dorothy spoke positively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t care. I must be grateful to somebody,”
wailed Tavia. “Don’t nip my finer feelings
in the bud. Your name should be Frost—Mademoiselle
Jacquesette Frost! You’re always
nipping me.”</p>

<p>Dorothy, however, remained grave. She
plainly saw that this incident foretold complications.
She had made up her mind that she and
Tavia would have nothing more to do with the
Westerner, Garry Knapp; and now her friend
would insist on thanking him—of course, she must
if only for politeness’ sake—and any further intercourse
with Mr. Knapp would make the situation
all the more difficult.</p>

<p>She wished with all her heart that their shopping
was over, and then she could insist upon taking
the train immediately out of New York, even
if she had to sink to the abhorred subterfuge of
playing ill, and so frightening Tavia.</p>

<p>She wished they might move to some other
hotel; but if they did that an explanation must
be made to Aunt Winnie as well as to Tavia. It
seemed to Dorothy that she blushed all over—fairly
<em>burned</em>—whenever she thought of discussing
her feelings regarding Garry Knapp.</p>

<p>Never before in her experience had Dorothy
Dale been so quickly and so favorably impressed
by a man. Tavia had joked about it, but she by
no means understood how deeply Dorothy felt.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
And Dorothy would have been mortified to the
quick had she been obliged to tell even her dearest
chum the truth.</p>

<p>Dorothy’s home training had been most delicate.
Of course, in the boarding school she and
Tavia had attended there were many sorts of
girls; but all were from good families, and Mrs.
Pangborn, the preceptress of Glenwood, had had
a strict oversight over her girls’ moral growth as
well as over their education.</p>

<p>Dorothy’s own cousins, Ned and Nat White,
though collegians, and of what Tavia called “the
harum-scarum type” like herself, were clean, upright
fellows and possessed no low ideas or tastes.
It seemed to Dorothy for a man to make the acquaintance
of a strange girl on the street and talk
with her as Garry Knapp seemed to have done,
savored of a very coarse mind, indeed.</p>

<p>And all the more did she criticise his action because
he had taken advantage of the situation of
herself and her friend and “picked acquaintance”
in somewhat the same fashion with them on their
entrance into New York.</p>

<p>He was “that kind.” He went about making
the acquaintance of every girl he saw who would
give him a chance to speak to her! That is the
way it looked to Dorothy in her present mood.</p>

<p>She gave Garry Knapp credit for being a Westerner
and being not as conservative as Eastern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
folk. She knew that people in the West were
freer and more easily to become acquainted with
than Eastern people. But she had set that girl
down as a common flirt, and she believed no gentleman
would so easily and naturally fall into conversation
with her as Garry Knapp had, unless he
were quite used to making such acquaintances.</p>

<p>It shamed Dorothy, too, to think that the young
man should go straight from her and Tavia to the
girl.</p>

<p>That was the thought that made the keenest
wound in Dorothy Dale’s mind.</p>

<p>They shopped “furiously,” as Tavia declared,
all the morning, only resting while they ate a bite
of luncheon in one of the big stores, and then went
at it again immediately afterward.</p>

<p>“The boys talk about ‘bucking the line’ about
this time of year—football slang, you know,”
sighed Tavia; “but believe me! this is some ‘bucking.’
I never shopped so fast and furiously in all
my life. Dorothy, you actually act as though you
wanted to get it all over with and go home. And
we can stay a week if we like. We’re having no
fun at all.”</p>

<p>Dorothy would not answer. She wished they
could go home. It seemed to her as though New
York City was not big enough in which to hide
away from Garry Knapp.</p>

<p>They could not secure seats—not those they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
wanted—for the play Ned and Nat had told them
to see, for that evening; and Tavia insisted upon
going back to the hotel.</p>

<p>“I am done up,” she announced. “I am a dish-rag.
I am a disgrace to look at, and I feel that
if I do not follow Lovely Lucy Larriper’s advice
and relax, I may be injured for life. Come, Dorothy,
we must go back to our rooms and lie down,
or I shall lie right down here in the gutter and do
my relaxing.”</p>

<p>They returned to the hotel, and Dorothy almost
ran through the lobby to the elevator, she
was so afraid that Garry Knapp would be waiting
there. She felt that he would be watching for
them. The note he had written her that morning
proved that he was determined to keep up
their acquaintanceship if she gave him the slightest
opening.</p>

<p>“And I’ll never let him—never!” she told herself
angrily.</p>

<p>“Goodness! how can you hurry so?” plaintively
panted Tavia, as she sank into the cushioned seat
in the elevator.</p>

<p>All the time they were resting, Dorothy was
thinking of Garry. He would surely be downstairs
at dinner time, waiting his chance to approach
them. She had a dozen ideas as to how
she would treat him—and none of them seemed
good ideas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>She was tempted to write him a note in answer
to the line he had left with the clerk for her that
morning, warning him never to speak to her friend
or herself again. But then, how could she do so
bold a thing?</p>

<p>Tavia got up at last and began to move about
her room. “Aren’t you going to get up ever again,
Doro?” she asked. “Doesn’t the inner man call
for sustenance? Or even the outer man? I’m just
crazy to see Garry Knapp and ask him how he
came by my bag.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tavia! I wish you wouldn’t,” groaned
Dorothy.</p>

<p>“Wish I wouldn’t what?” demanded her friend,
coming to her open door with a hairbrush in her
hand and wielding it calmly.</p>

<p>Dorothy “bit off” what she had intended to
say. She could not bring herself to tell Tavia all
that was in her mind. She fell back upon that
“white fib” that seems first in the feminine mind
when trouble portends:</p>

<p>“I’ve <em>such</em> a headache!”</p>

<p>“Poor dear!” cried Tavia. “I should think
you had. You ate scarcely any luncheon——”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t mention eating!” begged Dorothy,
and she really found she did have a slight headache
now that she had said so.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want your dinner?” cried Tavia,
in horror.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>“No, dear. Just let me lie here. You—you
go down and eat. Perhaps I’ll have something
light by and by.”</p>

<p>“That’s what the Esquimau said when he ate
the candle,” said Tavia, but without smiling. It
was a habit with Tavia, this saying something
funny when she was thinking of something entirely
foreign to her remark.</p>

<p>“You’re not going to be sick, are you, Doro?”
she finally asked.</p>

<p>“No, indeed, my dear.”</p>

<p>“Well! you’ve acted funny all day.”</p>

<p>“I don’t feel a bit funny,” groaned Dorothy.
“Don’t make me talk—now.”</p>

<p>So Tavia, who could be sympathetic when she
chose, stole away and dressed quietly. She looked
in at Dorothy when she was ready to go downstairs,
and as her chum lay with her eyes closed
Tavia went out without speaking.</p>

<p>Garry Knapp was fidgeting in the lobby when
Tavia stepped out of the car. His eye brightened—then
clouded again. Tavia noticed it, and her
conclusion bore out the thought she had evolved
about Dorothy upstairs.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Knapp!” she cried, meeting him with
both hands outstretched. “Tell me! How did you
find my bag?”</p>

<p>And Garry Knapp was impolite enough to put
her question aside for the moment while he asked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>“Where’s Miss Dale?”</p>

<p>Two hours later Tavia returned to her chum.
Garry walked out of the hotel with his face heavily
clouded.</p>

<p>“Just my luck! She’s a regular millionaire.
Her folks have got more money than I’ll ever
even <em>see</em> if I beat out old Methuselah in age! And
Miss Tavia says Miss Dale will be rich in her own
right. Ah, Garry, old man! There’s a blank
wall ahead of you. You can’t jump it in a hurry.
You haven’t got the <em>spring</em>. And this little mess
of money I may get for the old ranch won’t put
me in Miss Dorothy Dale’s class—not by a million
miles!”</p>

<p>He walked away from the hotel, chewing on this
thought as though it had a very, very bitter taste.</p>

<span class="fs80">AND STILL DOROTHY IS NOT HAPPY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“But what did he <em>say</em>?” demanded Dorothy,
almost wildly, sitting up in bed at Tavia’s first
announcement. “I want to know what he <em>said</em>!”</p>

<p>“We-ell, maybe he didn’t tell the truth,” said
Tavia, slowly.</p>

<p>“We’ll find out about that later,” Dorothy declared.
“Go on.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course we must hunt up these girls
and give them something for returning your bag.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I s’pose so,” Tavia said. “Though I
guess the little one, Number Forty-seven, wanted
to keep it.”</p>

<p>“Now, tell me <em>all</em>” breathed Dorothy, her eyes
shining. “All he said—every word.”</p>

<p>“Goodness! I guess your headache is better,
Doro Dale,” laughed Tavia, sitting down on the
edge of the bed. Dorothy said not a word, but
her “listening face” put Tavia on her mettle.</p>

<p>“Well, the very first thing he said,” she told
her chum, her eyes dancing, “when I ran up to him
and thanked him for getting my bag, was:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>“‘Where’s Miss Dale?’</p>

<p>“What do you know about <em>that</em>?” cried Tavia,
in high glee. “You have made a deep, wide, long,
and high impression—a four-dimension impression—on
that young man from the ‘wild and
woolly.’ Oh yes, you have!”</p>

<p>The faint blush that washed up into Dorothy
Dale’s face like a gentle wave on the sea-strand
made her look “ravishing,” so Tavia declared.
She simply had to stop to hug her friend before
she went on. Dorothy recovered her serenity almost
at once.</p>

<p>“Don’t tease, dear,” she said. “Go on with
your story.”</p>

<p>“You see, the little cash-girl—or ‘check’, as they
call them—picked the bag up off the floor and hid
it under her apron. Then she was scared—especially
when Mr. Schuman chanced to come upon
us all as we were quarreling. I suppose Mr. Schuman
seems like a god to little Forty-seven.</p>

<p>“Anyhow,” Tavia pursued, “whether the child
meant to steal the bag or not at first, she was
afraid to say anything about it then. Her sister—this
girl who came to the hotel—works in the
house furnishing department. Before night
Forty-seven told her sister. She had heard Mr.
Knapp’s name, and from the shipping clerk the
big girl obtained the name of the hotel at which
Mr. Knapp was staying. Do you see?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” breathed Dorothy. “Go on, dear.”</p>

<p>“Why, the girl just came here and asked for
Mr. Knapp and found he was out. She didn’t
know any better than to linger about outside and
wait for him to appear—like Mary’s little lamb,
you know! Little Forty-seven had told her sister
what Mr. Knapp looked like, of course.”</p>

<p>“Of course!” cried Dorothy, agreeing again,
but in such a tone that Tavia frankly stared at
her.</p>

<p>“I do wish I knew just what is the matter with
you to-day, Doro,” she murmured.</p>

<p>“And the rest of it?” demanded Dorothy, her
eyes shining and her cheeks still pink.</p>

<p>“Why, when little Forty-seven’s sister saw us
with Mr. Knapp she jumped to the correct conclusion
that we were the girls who had lost the money,
and so she was afraid to speak right out before
us——”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Well, Dorothy,” said Tavia, with considerable
gravity for her, “I guess because of the old and
well-established reason.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Because a man will be kinder to a girl
in trouble than other girls will—ordinarily, I
mean.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tavia!”</p>

<p>“Suppose it had been that Mrs. Halbridge who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
had really lost her bag,” Tavia went on to say.
“If this girl had tried to return it, she and little
Forty-seven both would have lost their jobs. Perhaps
the police would have been called in. Do you
see? I expect the big girl read kindness in Mr.
Knapp’s face——”</p>

<p>Dorothy suddenly threw both arms about
Tavia, and hugged her tightly. “Oh, you <em>dear</em>!”
she cried; but she would not explain what she
meant by this sudden burst of affection.</p>

<p>“Go on!” was her repeated demand.</p>

<p>“You are insatiable, my dear,” laughed Tavia.
“Well, there isn’t much more ‘go on’ to it. The
girl spoke to him when he passed her on the street
and quickly told him all the story. Of course, he
promised that nothing should happen to either of
them. They are honest girls—the older one at
least. And the temptation came so suddenly to
little Forty-seven, whose wages are so pitiably
small.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Dorothy, gently. “You remember,
we learned something about it when little
Miette De Pleau told us how she worked as cash-girl
here years ago.”</p>

<p>“Of course I remember,” Tavia said. “Well,
that’s all, I guess. Oh no! I asked Mr. Knapp
if he didn’t notice the big girl staring at us as we
got to the hotel door last night. And what do
you suppose he said?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know,” and Dorothy was still smiling
happily.</p>

<p>“Why, he said he didn’t. ‘You see,’ he added,
in that funny way of his, ‘I expect my eyes were
elsewhere’; and he wasn’t complimenting me,
either,” added Tavia, rolling her big eyes.
“Whom do you suppose he could have meant he
was looking at, Doro?”</p>

<p>Her friend ignored the question, but hopped
out of bed.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” asked Tavia, in
wonder.</p>

<p>“Dress.”</p>

<p>“But it is nine o’clock! Almost bedtime.”</p>

<p>“<em>Bedtime?</em>” demanded Dorothy. “And in the
city? Why, Tavia! you amaze me, child!”</p>

<p>“But you’re not going out?” cried her friend.</p>

<p>“Do you realize I haven’t had a bite of dinner?”
demanded the bold Dorothy. “I think you
are very selfish.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyway,” snapped Tavia, suddenly
showing her claws—and who does not once in a
while?—“<em>he’s</em> gone out for a long walk and he expects
to finish his business to-morrow and go
home.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” gasped Dorothy.</p>

<p>She sat on the edge of her bed with her first
stocking in her hand. Tavia had gone back into
her own room. Had she been present she must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
have noticed all the delight fading out of Dorothy
Dale’s countenance. Finally, the latter tossed
away the stocking, and crept back into bed.</p>

<p>“I—I guess I’m too lazy to dress after all,
dear,” she said, in a still little voice. “And you
are tired, too, Tavia. The telephone has been
fixed; just call down, will you, and ask them to
send me up some tea and toast?”</p>

<span class="fs80">THEY SEE GARRY’S BACK</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The following day Dorothy was her old
cheerful self—or so Tavia thought. They did not
shop with such abandon, but took matters more
easily. And they returned to the hotel for luncheon
and for rest.</p>

<p>“But he isn’t here!” Tavia exclaimed, when
they entered the big restaurant for the midday
meal. “And I remember now he said last evening
that he would probably be down town almost all
day to-day—trying to sell that property of his,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Who, dear?” asked Dorothy, with a far-away
look on her face.</p>

<p>“Peleg Swift!” snapped Tavia. “You know
very well of whom I am talking. Garry Owen!”
and she hummed a few bars of the old, old march.</p>

<p>Garry certainly was not present; but Dorothy
still smiled. They went out again and purchased
a few more things. When they returned late in
the afternoon the young Westerner was visible in
the lobby the moment the girls came through the
doorway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>But he was busy. He did not even see them.
He was talking with two men of pronounced New
York business type who might have been brokers
or Wall Street men. All three sat on a lounge
near the elevators, and Dorothy heard one of the
strangers say crisply, as she and Tavia waited for
a car:</p>

<p>“That’s our top price, I think, Mr. Knapp.
And, of course, we cannot pay you any money
until I have seen the land, save the hundred for
the option. I shall be out in a fortnight, I believe.
It must hang fire until then, even at this
price.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Stiffbold—it’s a bet!” Garry said,
and Dorothy could imagine the secret sigh he
breathed. Evidently, he was not getting the price
for the wornout ranch that he had hoped.</p>

<p>The two girls went up in the elevator and later
made their dinner toilet. To-night Dorothy was
the one who took the most pains in her primping;
but Tavia said never a word. Nevertheless, she
“looked volumes.”</p>

<p>They were downstairs again not much later
than half past six. Not a sign of Garry Knapp
either in the lobby or in the dining-room. The
girls ate their dinner slowly and “lived in hopes,”
as Tavia expressed it.</p>

<p>Both were frankly hoping Garry would appear.
Tavia was grateful to him for the part he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
had taken in the recovery of her bag; and, too,
he was “nice.” Dorothy felt that she had misjudged
the young Westerner, and she was fired
with a desire to be particularly pleasant to him so
as to salve over her secret compunctions of conscience.</p>

<p>“‘He cometh not, she said,’” Tavia complained.
“What’s the matter with the boy, anyway?
Can he be eating in the cafê with those two
men?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tavia!” suddenly exclaimed Dorothy.
“You said he was going home to-day.”</p>

<p>“Oh—ah—yes. He did say he expected to get
out for the West again some time to-day——”</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s go-o-one!” and Dorothy’s phrase
was almost a wail.</p>

<p>“Goodness! Never! Without looking us up
and saying a word of good-bye?”</p>

<p>Dorothy got up with determination. “I am going
to find out,” she said. “I feel that I would
like to see Mr. Knapp again.”</p>

<p>“Well! if <em>I</em> said a thing like that about a young
man——”</p>

<p>However, Tavia let the remark trail off into silence
and followed her chum. As they came out
of the dining-room the broad shoulders and broad-brimmed
hat of Garry Knapp were going through
the street door!</p>

<p>“Oh!” gasped Dorothy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>“He’s going!” added Tavia, stricken quite as
motionless.</p>

<p>“Going——”</p>

<p>“Gone!” ended Tavia, sepulchrally. “It’s all
off, Dorothy. Garry Knapp, of Desert City, has
departed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we must stop him—speak to him——”</p>

<p>Dorothy started for the door and Tavia, nothing
loath, followed at a sharp pace. Just as they
came out into the open street a car stopped before
the hotel door and Garry Knapp, “bag and
baggage” stepped aboard. He did not even look
back!</p>

<p>As the girls returned to the hotel lobby the two
men with whom they had seen Garry Knapp earlier
in the evening, were passing out. They lingered
while one of the men lit his cigar, and Dorothy
heard the second man speaking.</p>

<p>“I could have paid him spot cash for the land
right here and been sure of a bargain, Lightly. I
know just where it is and all about it. But it will
do no harm to let the thing hang fire till I get out
there. Perhaps, if I’m not too eager, I can get
him to knock off a few dollars per acre. The boy
wants to sell—that’s sure.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh!” grunted the one with the cigar. “It’ll
make a tidy piece of wheat land without doubt,
Stiffbold. You go for it!”</p>

<p>They passed out then and the girl who had listened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
followed her friend slowly to the elevator,
deep in thought. She said not a word until they
were upstairs again. Perhaps her heart was really
too full just then for utterance.</p>

<p>As they entered Dorothy’s room the girls saw
that the maid had been in during their absence at
dinner. There was a long box, unmistakably a
florist’s box, on the table.</p>

<p>“Oh, see what’s here!” cried Tavia, springing
forward.</p>

<p>The card on the box read: “Miss Dale.”</p>

<p>“For you!” cried Tavia. “What meaneth it,
fair Lady Dorothy? Hast thou made a conquest
already? Some sweet swain——”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you know what a ‘sweet swain’
is,” laughed Dorothy.</p>

<p>Her fingers trembled as she untied the purple
cord. Tavia asked, with increased curiosity:</p>

<p>“Who can they be from, Doro? Flowers, of
course!”</p>

<p>Dorothy said nothing in reply; but in her heart
she knew—she knew! The cord was untied at
last, the tissue paper, all fragrant and dewy, lifted.</p>

<p>“Why!” said Tavia, rather in disappointment
and doubt. “Not roses—or chrysanthemums—or—or——”</p>

<p>“Or anything foolish!” finished Dorothy,
firmly.</p>

<p>She lifted from their bed of damp moss a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
bouquet of the simplest old-fashioned flowers;
mignonette, and several long-stemmed, dewy violets
and buttercups, pansies, forget-me-nots——</p>

<p>“He must have been robbing all the old-fashioned
gardens around New York,” said Tavia.
“But that’s a lovely ribbon—and yards of it.”</p>

<p>Dorothy did not speak at first. The cost of
the gift meant nothing to her. Yet she knew that
the monetary value of such a bouquet in New
York must be far above what was ordinarily paid
for roses and the like.</p>

<p>A note was nestling in the stems. She opened
it and read:</p>
<br>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent">
“Dear Miss Dale:<br>
</p>

<p>“Was mighty sorry to hear you are still in retirement.
Your friend said last evening that you
were quite done-up. Now I am forced to leave
in a hurry without seeing you. Sent bellhop up to
your room and he reports ‘no answer.’</p>

<p>“But, without seeming too bold, will hope that
we shall meet again—and that these few flowers
will be a reminder of</p>

<span class="fs80">“HEART DISEASE”</span></h2>
</div>

<p>After one passes the railroad station at The
Beeches, and before reaching the town limits of
North Birchland, the traveler sees a gray road
following closely the railway tracks, sometimes divided
from them by rail-fences, sometimes by a
ditch, and sometimes the railway roadbed is high
on a bank overlooking the highway.</p>

<p>For several miles the road grades downward—not
a sharp grade, but a steady one—and so does
the railroad. At the foot of the slope the highway
keeps straight on over a bridge that spans the
deep and boisterous creek; but a fork of the road
turns abruptly and crosses the railroad at grade.</p>

<p>There is no flagman at this grade crossing,
nor is there a drop-gate. Just a “Stop, Look, Listen”
sign—two words of which are unnecessary, as
some philosopher has pointed out. There had
been some serious accidents at this crossing; but
thus far the railroad company had found it cheaper
to pay court damages than to pay a flagman and
the upkeep of a proper gate on both sides of its
right-of-way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>When they came in sight of the down-hill part
of the road Dorothy Dale and Tavia Travers
knew it was time to begin to put on their wraps
and take down their bags. The North Birchland
station would soon be in sight.</p>

<p>It was Dorothy who first stood up to reach for
her bag. As she did so she glanced through the
broad window, out upon the highway.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tavia!” she gasped.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, dear? You don’t see
Garry Knapp, do you? Maybe his buying those
flowers—that ‘parting blessing’—‘busted’ him and
he’s got to walk home clear to Desert City.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a goose!” half laughed Dorothy.
“Look out. See if you see what I see.”</p>

<p>“Why, Doro! it’s Joe and Roger I do believe!”</p>

<p>“I was sure it was,” returned her friend. “What
can those boys be doing now?”</p>

<p>“Well, what they are doing seems plain
enough,” said Tavia. “What they are going to
do is the moot question, my dear. You never
know what a boy will do next, or what he did last;
you’re only sure of what he is doing just now.”</p>

<p>What the young brothers of Dorothy Dale were
doing at that moment was easily explained. They
were riding down the long slope of the gray road
toward North Birchland, racing with the train
Dorothy and Tavia were on. The vehicle upon
which the boys were riding was a nondescript thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
composed of a long plank, four wheels, a steering
arrangement of more or less dependence, and a
soap box.</p>

<p>In the soap box was a bag, and unless the girls
were greatly mistaken Joe and Roger Dale had
been nutting over toward The Beeches, and the
bag was filled with hickory nuts and chestnuts in
their shells and burrs.</p>

<p>Roger, who was the youngest, and whom Dorothy
continued to look upon as a baby, occupied the
box with the nuts. Joe, who was fifteen, straddled
the plank with his feet on the rests and steered.
The boys’ vehicle was going like the wind. It
looked as though a small stone in the road, or an
uncertain jerk by Joe on the steering lines, would
throw the contraption on which they rode sideways
and dump out the boys.</p>

<p>“Enough to give one heart disease,” said Tavia.
“I declare! small brothers are a nuisance. When
I’m at home in Dalton I have to wear blinders so
as not to see <em>my</em> kid brothers at their antics.”</p>

<p>“If something should happen, Tavia!” murmured
Dorothy.</p>

<p>“Something is always happening. But not often
is it something bad,” said Tavia, coolly.
“‘There’s a swate little cherub that sits up aloft,
and kapes out an eye for poor Jack,’ as the Irish
tar says. And there is a similar cherub looking
out for small boys—or a special providence.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>The train was now high on the embankment
over the roadway. The two boys sliding down
the hill looked very small, indeed, below the car
windows.</p>

<p>“Suppose a wagon should start up the hill,”
murmured Dorothy.</p>

<p>“There’s none in sight. I never saw the road
more deserted—oh, Doro!”</p>

<p>Tavia uttered this cry before she thought. She
had looked far ahead to the foot of the hill and
had seen something that her friend had not yet
observed.</p>

<p>“What is it?” gasped Dorothy, whose gaze was
still fixed upon her brothers.</p>

<p>“My dear! The bridge!”</p>

<p>The words burst from Tavia involuntarily.
She could not keep them in.</p>

<p>At the foot of the hill the road forked as has
before been shown. To the left it crossed the railroad
tracks at grade. Of course, these reckless
boys had not intended to try for the crossing ahead
of the train. But the main road, which kept
straight on beside the tracks, crossed the creek
on a wooden bridge. Tavia, looking ahead, saw
that the bridge boards were up and there was a
rough fence built across the main road!</p>

<p>“They’ll be killed!” screamed Dorothy Dale,
and sank back into her chair.</p>

<p>The train was now pitching down the grade.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
It was still a mile to the foot of the slope where
railroad and highway were on a level again. The
boys in their little “scooter” were traveling faster
than the train itself, for the brakes had been applied
when the descent was begun.</p>

<p>The boys and their vehicle, surrounded by a
little halo of dust, were now far ahead of the
chair car in which their sister and Tavia rode.
The girls, clinging to each other, craned their
necks to see ahead. There were not many other
passengers in the car and nobody chanced to notice
the horror-stricken girls.</p>

<p>It was a race between the boys and the train,
and the boys would never be able to halt their
vehicle on the level at the bottom of the hill before
crashing into the fence that guarded the open
bridge.</p>

<p>Were the barrier not there, the little cart would
dart over the edge of the masonry wall of the
bridge and all be dashed into the deep and rock-strewn
bed of the creek.</p>

<p>There was but one escape for the boys in any
event. Perhaps their vehicle could be guided to
the left, into the branch road and so across the
railroad track. But if Joe undertook that would
not the train be upon them?</p>

<p>“Heart disease,” indeed! It seemed to Dorothy
Dale as though her own heart pounded so
that she could no longer breathe. Her eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
strained to see the imperiled boys down in the
road.</p>

<p>The “scooter” ran faster and faster or was the
train itself slowing down?</p>

<p>“For sure and certain they are beating us!”
murmured Tavia.</p>

<p>She could appreciate the sporting chance in the
race; but to Dorothy there loomed up nothing but
the peril facing her brothers.</p>

<p>The railroad tracks pitched rather sharply here.
It was quite a descent into the valley where North
Birchland lay. When the engineers of the passenger
trains had any time to make up running
west they could always regain schedule on this
slope.</p>

<p>Dorothy knew this. She realized that the engineer,
watching the track ahead and not the roadway
where the boys were, might be tempted to
release his brakes when half way down the slope
and increase his speed.</p>

<p>If he did so and the boys, Joe and Roger,
turned to cross the rails, the train must crash into
the “scooter.”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br>
<span class="fs80">A BOLD THING TO DO!</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The threatening peril—which looked so sure
to Dorothy Dale if to nobody else—inspired her
to act, not to remain stunned and helpless. She
jerked her hand from Tavia’s clutch and sprang
to her feet. She had been reaching for her bag
on first observing the boys coasting down the long
hill beside the railroad tracks; and her umbrella
was in the rack, too. She seized this. Its handle
was a shepherd’s crook. Reaching with it, and
without a word to Tavia, she hooked the handle
into the emergency cord that ran overhead the
length of the car, and pulled down sharply. Instantly
there was a shriek from the engine whistle
and the brakes were sharply applied.</p>

<p>The brake shoes so suddenly applied to the
wheels on this downgrade did much harm to the
wheels themselves. Little cared Dorothy for this
well-known fact. If every wheel under the train
had to go to the repair shop she would have made
this bold attempt to stop the train or retard its
speed, so that Joe and Roger could cross the
tracks ahead of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>Glancing through the window she saw the boys’
“scooter” dart swiftly and safely into the fork-road
and disappear some rods ahead of the pilot
of the engine. The boys were across before the
brakeman and the Pullman conductor opened the
car door and rushed in.</p>

<p>“Who pulled that emergency cord? Anybody
here?” shouted the conductor.</p>

<p>“Oh! don’t tell him!” breathed Tavia.</p>

<p>But her friend, if physically afraid, was never
a moral coward. She looked straight into the
angry conductor’s face and said:</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“What for?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“To stop the train. My brothers were in danger——”</p>

<p>“Say! What’s that?” demanded the Pullman
conductor of Tavia. “Where are her brothers?”</p>

<p>The brakeman, who had long run over this road,
pulled at the conductor’s sleeve.</p>

<p>“That’s Major Dale’s girl,” he whispered, and
Tavia heard if Dorothy did not.</p>

<p>“Who’s Major Dale?” asked the conductor, in
a low voice, turning aside. “Somebody on the
road?”</p>

<p>“Owns stock in it all right. And a bigwig
around North Birchland. Go easy, I say,” advised
the brakeman, immediately turning back to
the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>The train, meanwhile, had started on again,
for undoubtedly the other conductor had given
the engineer the signal to go ahead. Through the
window across the car Dorothy could see out upon
the road beyond the tracks. There was the little
“scooter” at a standstill. Joe and Roger were
standing up and waving their caps at the train.</p>

<p>“They’re safe!” Dorothy cried to Tavia.</p>

<p>“I see they are; but you’re not—yet,” returned
her chum.</p>

<p>“Who’s that is safe?” asked the conductor, still
in doubt.</p>

<p>“My brothers—there,” answered Dorothy,
pointing. “They had to cross in front of the train
because the bridge is open. They couldn’t stop at
the bottom of the hill.”</p>

<p>The Pullman conductor understood at last.
“But I’ll have to make a report of this, Miss
Dale,” he said, complainingly.</p>

<p>Dorothy had seated herself and she was very
pale. The fright for her at least had been serious.</p>

<p>“Make a dozen reports if you like—help yourself,”
said Tavia, tartly, bending over her friend.
“If there is anything to pay send the bill to Major
Dale.”</p>

<p>The conductor grumbled something and went
out, notebook in hand. In a few moments the
train came to a standstill at the North Birchland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
station. The girls had to bestir themselves to get
out in season, and that helped rouse Dorothy.</p>

<p>“Those rascals!” said Tavia, once they were
on the platform. “Joe and Roger should be
spanked.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid Joe is too big for that,” sighed
Dorothy. “And who would spank them? It is
something they didn’t get when they were little——”</p>

<p>“And see the result!”</p>

<p>“Your brothers were whipped sufficiently, I am
sure,” Dorothy said, smiling at length. “They are
not one whit better than Joe and Roger.”</p>

<p>“Dear me! that’s so,” admitted Tavia. “But
just the same, I belieev in whippings—for boys.”</p>

<p>“And no whippings for girls?”</p>

<p>“I should say not!” cried Tavia. “There never
<em>was</em> a girl who deserved corporal punishment.”</p>

<p>“Not even Nita Brandt?” suggested Dorothy,
naming a girl who had ever been a thorn in the
flesh for Tavia during their days at Glenwood.</p>

<p>“Well—perhaps <em>she</em>. But Nita’s about the
only one, I guess.”</p>

<p>The next moment Tavia started to run down
the long platform, dropping her bag and screaming:</p>

<p>“Jennie Hapgood! Jennie Jane Jemina Jerusha
Happiness—<em>good</em>! How ever came you
here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>Dorothy was excited, too, when she saw the
pretty girl whom Tavia greeted with such ebullition;
but she looked beyond Jennie Hapgood, the
expected guest from Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>There was the boys’ new car beside the station
platform and Ned was under the steering-wheel
while Nat was just getting out after Jennie. Of
course, the two girls just back from New York
were warmly kissed by Jennie. Then Nat came
next and before Tavia realized what was being
done to her, she was soundly kissed, too!</p>

<p>“Bold, bad thing!” she cried, raising a gloved
hand toward the laughing Nat. But it never
reached him. Then Dorothy had to submit—as
she always did—to the bearlike hugs of both her
cousins, for Ned quickly joined them on the platform.
Tavia escaped Ned—if, indeed, he had intended
to follow his brother’s example.</p>

<p>“What is the use of having a pretty cousin,”
the White boys always said, “if we can’t kiss her?
Keeps our hands in, you know. And if she has
pretty friends, why shouldn’t we kiss them, too?”</p>

<p>“Did you boys kiss Jennie when she arrived this
morning?” Tavia demanded, repairing the ruffled
hair that had fallen over her ears.</p>

<p>“Certainly!” declared Nat, boldly. “Both of
us.”</p>

<p>“They never!” cried Jennie, turning very red.
“You know I wouldn’t let these boys kiss me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>“I bet a boy kissed you the last thing before
you started up here from home,” teased Nat.</p>

<p>“I <em>never</em> let boys kiss me,” repeated Jennie.</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” drawled Ned, joining in with his
brother. “How about Jack?”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, <em>Jack</em>!”</p>

<p>“Jack isn’t a boy, I suppose?” hooted Nat. “I
guess that girl he’s going to marry about Christmas
time thinks he’s a pretty nice boy.”</p>

<p>“But he’s only my brother,” announced Jennie
Hapgood, tossing her head.</p>

<p>“Is he really?” cried Tavia, clasping her hands
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Is he really my brother?” demanded Jennie,
in amazement. “Why, you <em>know</em> he is, Tavia
Travers!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! I mean are they going to be married
at Christmas?”</p>

<p>“Yes. That is the plan now. And you’ve all
got to come to Sunnyside to the wedding. Nothing
less would suit Jack—or father and mother,”
Jennie said happily. “So prepare accordingly.”</p>

<p>Nat raced with Tavia for the bag she had
dropped. He got it and clung to it all the way
in the car to The Cedars, threatening to open it
and examine its contents.</p>

<p>“For I know very well that Tavia’s got oodles
of new face powder and rouge, and a rabbit’s foot
to put it on with—or else a kalsomine brush,” Nat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
declared. “Joe and Roger want to paint the old
pigeon house, anyway, and this stuff Tavia’s got
in here will be just the thing.”</p>

<p>In fact, the two big fellows were so glad to see
their cousin and Tavia again that they teased
worse than ever. A queer way to show their affection,
but a boy’s way, after all. And, of course,
everybody else at the Cedars was delighted to
greet Dorothy and Tavia. It was some time before
the returned travelers could run upstairs to
change their dresses for dinner. Jennie had gone
into her room to change, too, and Tavia came to
Dorothy’s open door.</p>

<p>“Oh, that letter!” she exclaimed, seeing Dorothy
standing very gravely with a letter in her
hand. “Haven’t you sent it?”</p>

<p>“You see I haven’t,” Dorothy said seriously.</p>

<p>“But why not?”</p>

<p>“It seems such a bold thing to do,” confessed
her friend. “We know so little about him. And
it might encourage him to write in return——”</p>

<p>“Of course it will!” laughed Tavia.</p>

<p>“There! that’s what I mean. It is bold.”</p>

<p>“But, you silly!” cried Tavia. “You only write
Mr. Knapp to do him a good turn. And he did
us a good turn—at least, he did <em>me</em> one that I shall
never forget.”</p>

<p>“True,” Dorothy said thoughtfully. “And I
have only repeated to him in this note what I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
heard that man, Stiffbold, say about the purchase
of Mr. Knapp’s ranch.”</p>

<p>“Oh, help the poor fellow out. Those men will
rob him,” Tavia advised. “Why didn’t you send
it at once, when you had written it?”</p>

<p>“I—I thought I’d wait and consult Aunt Winnie,”
stammered Dorothy.</p>

<p>“Then consult her.”</p>

<p>“But—but <em>now</em> I don’t want to.”</p>

<p>Tavia looked at her with certainty in her own
gaze. “I know what is the matter with you,” she
said.</p>

<p>Dorothy flushed quickly and Tavia shook her
head, saying nothing more. But when the girls
went downstairs to dinner, Tavia saw Dorothy
drop the stamped letter addressed to “Mr. Garford
Knapp, Desert City,” into the mail bag in the
hall.</p>

<span class="fs80">UNCERTAINTIES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Dorothy had no time before dinner, but after
that meal she seized upon her brothers, Joe and
Roger, and led them aside. The boys thought she
had something nice for them, brought from New
York. They very quickly found out their mistake.</p>

<p>“I want to know what you boys mean by taking
such risks as you did this afternoon?” she demanded,
when out of hearing of the rest of the
family. She would not have her aunt or the major
troubled by knowing of the escapade.</p>

<p>“You, especially, Joe,” she went on, with an accusing
finger raised. “You both might have been
killed. <em>Then</em> how would you have felt?”</p>

<p>“Er—dead, I guess, Sister,” admitted Roger,
for Joe was silent.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you know the road was closed because
of repairs on the bridge?” she asked the older
boy sternly.</p>

<p>“No-o. We forgot. We didn’t go over to
the nutting woods that way. Say! who told you?”
blurted out Joe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>“Who told me what?”</p>

<p>“About our race with the train. Cricky, but
it was great!”</p>

<p>“It was fine!” Roger added his testimony with
equal enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“I saw you,” said Dorothy, her face paling as
she remembered her fright in the train. “I—I
thought I should faint I was so frightened.”</p>

<p>“Say! isn’t that just like a girl?” grumbled Joe;
but he looked at his sister with some compunction,
for he and Roger almost worshipped her.
Only, of course, they were boys and the usual
boy cannot understand the fluttering terror in the
usual girl’s heart when danger threatens. Not
that Dorothy was a weakling in any way; she could
be courageous for herself. But her fears were
always excited when those she loved were in peril.</p>

<p>“Why, we were only having fun, Sister,” Roger
blurted out. Being considerably younger than his
brother he was quicker to be moved by Dorothy’s
expression of feeling.</p>

<p>“Fun!” she gasped.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Joe said sturdily. “It was a great race.
And you and Tavia were in that train? We
didn’t have an idea, did we, Roger?”</p>

<p>“Nop,” said his small brother thoughtlessly.
“If we had we wouldn’t have raced <em>that</em> train.”</p>

<p>“Now, I want to tell you something!” exclaimed
their sister, with a sharper note in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
voice. “You’re not to race <em>any</em> train! Understand,
boys? Suppose that engine had struck you
as you crossed the tracks?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it wouldn’t,” Joe said stoutly. “I know
the engineer. He’s a friend of mine. He saw
I had the ‘right-of-way,’ as they call it. I’d beat
him down the hill; so he held up the train.”</p>

<p>“Yes—he held up the train,” said Dorothy with
a queer little laugh. “He put on brakes because I
pulled the emergency cord. You boys would never
have crossed ahead of that train if I hadn’t done
so.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Dorothy!” gasped Joe.</p>

<p>“Oh, Sister!” cried Roger.</p>

<p>“Tavia and I almost had heart disease,” the
young woman told them seriously. “Engineers
do not watch boys on country roads when they
are guiding a great express train. It is a serious
matter to control a train and to have the destinies
of the passengers in one’s hands. The engineer is
looking ahead—watching the rails and the roadbed.
Remember that, boys.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to be an engineer!” sighed Roger, his
eyes big with longing.</p>

<p>“Pooh!” Joe said. “It’s more fun to drive an
automobile—like this new one Ned and Nat have.
You don’t have to stay on the tracks, you know.”</p>

<p>“Nobody but cautious people can learn to drive
automobiles,” said Dorothy, seriously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>“I’m big enough,” stated Joe, with conviction.</p>

<p>“You may be. But you’re not careful enough,”
his sister told him. “Your racing our train to-day
showed that. Now, I won’t tell father or
auntie, for I do not wish to worry them. But you
must promise me not to ride down that hill in
your little wagon any more or enter into any such
reckless sports.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we won’t, of course, if you say not, Dorothy,”
sniffed Joe. “But you must remember we’re
boys and boys have got to take chances. Even
father says that.”</p>

<p>“Yes. When you are grown. You may be
placed in situations where your courage will be
tested. But, goodness me!” finished Dorothy
Dale. “Don’t scare us to death, boys. And now
see what I bought you in New York.”</p>

<p>However, her lecture made some impression
upon the boys’ minds despite their excitement over
the presents which were now brought to light.
Full football outfits for both the present was, and
Joe and Roger were delighted. They wanted to
put them on and go out at once with the ball to
“pass signals,” dark as it had become.</p>

<p>However, they compromised on this at Dorothy’s
advice, by taking the suits, pads and guards
off to their room and trying them on, coming downstairs
later to “show off” before the folks in the
drawing-room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>Major Dale was one of those men who never
grow old in their hearts. Crippled as he was—both
by his wounded leg and by rheumatism—he
delighted to see the young life about him, and
took as much interest in the affairs of the young
people as ever he had.</p>

<p>Aunt Winnie looked a very interesting invalid,
indeed, with her lame ankle, and rested on the
couch. The big boys and Dorothy and her friends
always made much of Aunt Winnie in any case;
now that she was “laid up in drydock,” as Nat expressed
it, they were especially attentive.</p>

<p>Jennie and Tavia, with the two older boys,
spent most of the evening hovering about the
lady’s couch, or at the piano where they played
and sang college songs and old Briarwood songs,
till eleven o’clock. Dorothy sat between her
father and Aunt Winnie and talked to them.</p>

<p>“What makes you so sober, Captain?” the
major asked during the evening. He had always
called her “his little captain” and sometimes
seemed really to forget that she had any other
name.</p>

<p>“I’m all right, Major,” she returned brightly.
“I have to think, sometimes, you know.”</p>

<p>“What is the serious problem now, Dorothy?”
asked her aunt, with a little laugh. “Did you forget
to buy something while you were in New
York?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>Dorothy dimpled. “Wait till you see all I did
buy,” she responded, “and you will not ask that
question. I have been the most reckless person!”</p>

<p>“Why the serious pucker to your brow, Captain?”
went on the major.</p>

<p>“Oh, I have problems. I admit the fact,” Dorothy
said, trying to laugh off their questioning.</p>

<p>“Out with them,” advised her father. “Here
are two old folks who have been solving problems
all their lives. Maybe we can help.”</p>

<p>Dorothy laughed again. “Try this one,” she
said, with her eyes upon the quartette “harmonizing”
at the piano in dulcet tones, singing “Seeing
Nellie Ho-o-ome.” “Which of our big boys does
Tavia like best?”</p>

<p>“Goodness!” exclaimed her aunt, while the
major chuckled mellowly. “Don’t you know,
really, Dorothy? I was going to ask <em>you</em>. I
thought, of course, Tavia confided everything to
you.”</p>

<p>“Sooner or later she may,” the young woman
said, still with the thoughtful air upon her. “But
I am as much in the dark about this query as anybody—perhaps
as the boys themselves.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” muttered the major. “Which of
them likes <em>her</em> the better?”</p>

<p>“And <em>that</em> I’d like to know,” said his sister
earnestly. “There is another thing, Dorothy:
Which of my sons is destined to fall in love with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
this very, very pretty girl you have invited here—Jennie
Hapgood, I mean?”</p>

<p>“Oh! they’re all doing it, are they?” grunted
the major. “How about our Dorothy? Where
does she come in? No mate for her?”</p>

<p>“I think I shall probably become an old maid,”
Dorothy Dale said, but with a conscious flush that
made her aunt watch her in a puzzled way for
some time.</p>

<p>But the major put back his head and laughed
delightedly. “No more chance of your remaining
a spinster—when you are really old enough
to be called one—than there is of my leading
troops into battle again,” he declared with
warmth. “Hey, Sister?”</p>

<p>“Our Dorothy is too attractive I am sure to
escape the chance to marry, at least,” said Aunt
Winnie, still watching her niece with clouded gaze.
“I wonder whence the right knight will come riding—from
north, or south, east or west?”</p>

<p>And in spite of herself Dorothy flushed up
again at her aunt’s last word.</p>

<p>It was a question oft-repeated in Dorothy
Dale’s mind during the following days, this one
regarding the state of mind of her two cousins
and her two school friends.</p>

<p>It had always seemed to Dorothy, whenever
she had thought of it, that one of her cousins,
either Ned or Nat, must in the end be preferred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
by Tavia. To think of Tavia’s really settling
down to caring for any other man than Ned or
Nat, was quite impossible.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the boys had both shown a
great fondness for the society of Jennie Hapgood
when they were all at her home in Pennsylvania
such a short time previous; and now that all four
were together again Dorothy could not guess
“which was which” as Tavia herself would have
said.</p>

<p>The boys did not allow Dorothy to be overlooked
in any particular. She was not neglected
in the least; yet she did, as the days passed, find
more time to spend with her father and with her
Aunt Winnie.</p>

<p>“The little captain is getting more thoughtful.
She is steadying down,” the major told Mrs.
White.</p>

<p>“But I wonder <em>why</em>?” was that good woman’s
puzzled response.</p>

<p>Dorothy Dale sitting by herself with a book
that she was not reading or with fancywork on
which she only occasionally took stitches, was entirely
out of her character. She had never been
this way before going to New York, Mrs. White
was sure.</p>

<p>There were several uncertainties upon the girl’s
mind. One of them almost came to light when,
after ten days, her letter addressed to “Mr. Garford<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
Knapp, Desert City,” was returned to her
by the post-office department, as instructed in the
upper left-hand corner of the envelope.</p>

<p>Her letter, warning Garry Knapp of the advantage
the real estate men wished to take of him,
would, after all, do him no good. He would
never know that she had written. Perhaps her
path and Garry Knapp’s would never cross again.</p>

<span class="fs80">DOROTHY MAKES A DISCOVERY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The boys had a dog—Old Brindle he was
called—and he had just enough bull in him to
make him a faithful friend and a good watchdog.
But, of course, he was of little use in the woods,
and Joe and Roger were always begging for a
hunting dog.</p>

<p>“We’ve got these now—pump-rifles,” Roger
said eagerly to Dorothy, whom he thought able
to accomplish any wonder she might undertake.
“They shoot fifty shots. Think of it, Sister!
That’s a lot. And father taught us how to use
’em long ago, of course. Just think! I could
stand right up and shoot down fifty people—just
like that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Roger!” gasped Dorothy. “Don’t say
such awful things.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t, you know; but I could,” the
boy said confidently. “Now the law is off rabbits
and partridges and quail. Joe and I saw lots
of ’em when we went after those nuts the other
day. If we’d had our guns along maybe we might
have shot some.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>“The poor little birds and the cunning little
rabbits,” said Dorothy with a sigh.</p>

<p>“Oh! they’re not like our pigeons and our tame
rabbits. These are real <em>wild</em>. If some of ’em
weren’t shot they’d breed an’ breed till there were
so many that maybe it wouldn’t be safe to go out
into the woods,” declared the small boy, whose
imagination never needed spurring.</p>

<p>Joe came up on the porch in time to hear this
last. He chuckled, but Dorothy was saying to
Roger:</p>

<p>“How foolish, dear! Who ever heard of a
rabbit being cross?”</p>

<p>“Just the same I guess you’ve heard of being
as ‘mad as a March hare,’ haven’t you?” demanded
Joe, his eyes twinkling. “And we <em>do</em> want
a bird dog, Sis, to jump a rabbit for us, or to
flush a flock of quail.”</p>

<p>“Those dear little bobwhites,” Dorothy sighed
again. “Why is it that boys want always to kill?”</p>

<p>“So’s to eat,” Joe said bluntly. “You know
yourself, Dorothy Dale, that you like partridge
on toast and rabbit stew.”</p>

<p>She laughed at them. “I shall go hungry, then,
I’m afraid, as far as you boys are concerned.”</p>

<p>“Of course we can’t get any game if we don’t
have a dog. Brindle couldn’t jump a flea,”
growled Joe.</p>

<p>“Say! the big fellows used to have lots more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
pets than we’ve got,” complained Roger, referring
to Ned and Nat.</p>

<p>“<em>They</em> had dogs,” added Joe. “A whole raft
of ’em.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me!” exclaimed Dorothy. “I’ll see
what can be done. But another dog!”</p>

<p>“We won’t let him bite you, Sister,” proclaimed
Roger. “We only want him to chase rabbits or
to start up the birds so we can shoot ’em.”</p>

<p>Dorothy’s “I’ll see” was, of course, taken by
the boys themselves as an out-and-out agreement
to do as the boys desired. They were convinced
that if she gave her mind to it their sister could
perform almost any miracle. At least, she could
always bring the rest of the family around to her
way of thinking.</p>

<p>Ned and Nat had opposed the bringing of another
dog upon the place. They were fond of
old Brindle; but it must be confessed that the
watchdog was bad tempered where other dogs
were concerned.</p>

<p>Brindle seldom went off the place; but if he
saw any other dog trespassing he was very apt to
fly at the uninvited visitor. And once the bull’s
teeth were clinched in the strange animal’s neck,
it took a hot iron to make him loose his hold.</p>

<p>There had been several such unfortunate happenings,
and Mrs. White had paid several owners
of dogs damages rather than have trouble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
with the neighbors. She—and even the major—had
strong objections to the coming of any other
dog upon the place as long as Brindle lived.</p>

<p>So the chance for Joe and Roger to have their
request granted was small indeed. Nevertheless,
“hope springs eternal,” especially in the breast of
a small boy who wants a dog.</p>

<p>“Maybe we can find somebody that’s got a good,
trained dog and will sell him to us, Roger,” Joe
said, as they set forth from the house.</p>

<p>“But I haven’t got much money—only what’s
in the bank, and I can’t get that,” complained
Roger.</p>

<p>“You spend all you get for candy,” scoffed Joe.
“Now, <em>I’ve</em> got a whole half dollar left of my
month’s spending money. But you can’t buy much
of a dog for fifty cents.”</p>

<p>“Maybe somebody would give us a dog.”</p>

<p>“And folks don’t give away good dogs, either,”
grumbled Joe.</p>

<p>“I tell you!” exclaimed Roger, suddenly. “I
saw a stray dog yesterday going down the lane
behind our stables.”</p>

<p>“How do you know it was a stray dog?”</p>

<p>“’Cause it <em>looked</em> so. It was sneaking along
at the edge of the hedge and it was tired looking.
Then, it had a piece of frayed rope tied around
its neck. Oh, it was a stray dog all right,” declared
the smaller boy eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>“Where’d it go to?”</p>

<p>“Under Mr. Cummerford’s barn,” said Roger.
“I bet we could coax it out, if it’s still there.”</p>

<p>“Not likely,” grunted Joe.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he started off at once in the direction
indicated by his brother, and the boys were
soon at the stable of the neighbor whose place adjoined
The Cedars on that side.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, the dog was still there. He had
crawled out and lay in the sun beside the barn.
He was emaciated, his eyes were red and rolling,
and he had a lame front paw. The gray, frayed
rope was still tied to his neck. He was a regular
tramp dog.</p>

<p>But he allowed the boys to come close to him
without making any attempt to get away. He
eyed them closely, but neither growled nor wagged
his tail. He was a “funny acting” dog, as Roger
said.</p>

<p>“I bet he hasn’t had anything to eat for so long
and he’s come so far that he hasn’t got the spunk
to wag his tail,” Joe said, as eager as Roger now.
“We’ll take him home and feed him.”</p>

<p>“He’s sure a stray dog, isn’t he, Joe?” cried
the smaller boy. “I haven’t ever seen him before
around here, have you?”</p>

<p>“No. And I bet his owner won’t ever come
after him,” said Joe, picking up the end of the
rope. “He’s just the kind of a dog we want, too.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
You see, he’s a bird dog, or something like that.
And when he’s fed up and rested, I bet he’ll know
just how to go after partridges.”</p>

<p>He urged the strange dog to his feet. The
beast tottered, and would have lain down again.
Roger, the tender-hearted, said:</p>

<p>“Oh! he’s so hungry. Bet he hasn’t had a
thing to eat for days. Maybe we’ll have to carry
him.”</p>

<p>“No. He’s too dirty to carry,” Joe said, looking
at the mud caked upon the long hair of the
poor creature and the dust upon him. “We’ll get
him to the stable and feed him; then we’ll hose
him off.”</p>

<p>Pulling at the rope he urged the dog on. The
animal staggered at first, but finally grew firmer
on his legs. But he did not use the injured fore
paw. He favored that as he hopped along to the
White stables. Neither the coachman nor the
chauffeur were about. There was nobody to observe
the dog or advise the boys about the beast.
Roger ran to the kitchen door to beg some scraps
for their new possession. The cook would always
give Roger what he asked for. When he
came back Joe got a pan of water for the dog;
but the creature backed away from it and whined—the
first sound he had made.</p>

<p>“Say! isn’t that funny?” Joe demanded. “See!
he won’t drink. You’d think he’d be thirsty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>“Try him with this meat,” Roger said.
“Maybe he’s too hungry to drink at first.”</p>

<p>The dog was undoubtedly starving. Yet he
turned his head away from the broken pieces of
food Roger put down before his nose.</p>

<p>Joe had tied the rope to a ring on the side of
the stable. The boys stepped back to see if the
dog would eat or drink if they were not so close
to him. Then it was that the creature flew into
an awful spasm. He rose up, his eyes rolling,
trembling in every limb, and trying to break the
rope that fastened him to the barn. Froth flew
from his clashing jaws. His teeth were terrible
fangs. He fell, rolling over, snapping at the
water-dish. The boys, even Joe, ran screaming
from the spot.</p>

<p>At the moment Dorothy, Tavia and Jennie came
walking down the path toward the stables. They
heard the boys scream and all three started to
run. Ned and Nat, nearer the house, saw the
girls running and they likewise bounded down the
sloping lawn.</p>

<p>Around the corner of the stables came Joe and
Roger, the former almost dragging the smaller
boy by the hand. And, almost at the same instant,
appeared the dog, the broken rope trailing, bounding,
snapping, rolling over, acting as insanely as
ever a dog acted.</p>

<p>“Oh! what’s the matter?” cried Dorothy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>“Keep away from that dog!” shrieked Tavia,
stopping short and seizing both Dorothy and Jennie.
“He’s mad!”</p>

<p>The dog was blindly running, this way and
that, the foam dripping from his clashing jaws.
He was, indeed, a most fearful sight. He had no
real intention in his savage charges, for a beast
so afflicted with rabies loses eyesight as well as
sense; but suddenly he bounded directly for the
three girls.</p>

<p>They all shrieked in alarm, even Dorothy. Yet
the latter the better held her self-possession than
the others. She heard Jennie scream: “Oh, Ned!”
while Tavia cried: “Oh, Nat!”</p>

<p>The young men were at the spot in a moment.
Nat had picked up a croquet mallet and one good
blow laid the poor dog out—harmless forever
more.</p>

<p>Tavia had seized the rescuer’s arm, Jennie was
clinging to Ned. Dorothy, awake at last to the
facts of the situation, made a great discovery—and
almost laughed, serious as the peril had been.</p>

<p>“I believe I know which is which now,” she
thought, forgetting her alarm.</p>

<span class="fs80">TAVIA IS DETERMINED</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“After that scare I’m afraid the boys will have
to go without a bird dog,” Tavia said that night
as she and Dorothy were brushing their hair before
the latter’s dressing-glass.</p>

<p>Tavia and Jennie and Ned and Nat were almost
inseparable during the daytime; but when the
time came to retire the flyaway girl had to have
an old-time “confab,” as she expressed it, with
her chum.</p>

<p>Dorothy was so bright and so busy all day long
that nobody discovered—not even the major—that
she was rather “out of it.” The two couples
of young folk sometimes ran away and left Dorothy
busy at some domestic task in which she
claimed to find much more interest than in the
fun her friends and cousins were having.</p>

<p>“It would have been a terrible thing if the poor
dog had bitten one of us,” Dorothy replied. “Dr.
Agnew, the veterinary, says without doubt it was
afflicted with rabies.”</p>

<p>“And how scared your Aunt Winnie was!”
Then Tavia began to giggle. “She will be so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
afraid of anything that barks now, that she’ll
want all the trees cut down around the house.”</p>

<p>“That pun is unworthy of you, my dear,” Dorothy
said placidly.</p>

<p>“Dear me, Doro Doodlekins!” exclaimed
Tavia, suddenly and affectionately, coming close
to her chum and kissing her warmly. “You are
such a tabby-cat all of a sudden. Why! <em>you</em> have
grown up, while the rest of us are only kids.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I am very settled,” observed Dorothy,
smiling into the mirror at her friend. “A cap for
me and knitting very soon, Tavia. Then I shall
sit in the chimney corner and think——”</p>

<p>“Think about whom, my dear?” Tavia asked
saucily. “That Garry Knapp, I bet.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t <em>bet</em>,” sighed Dorothy. “It isn’t
ladylike.”</p>

<p>“Oh—de-ah—me!” groaned Tavia. “You are
thinking of him just the same.”</p>

<p>“I happened to be just now,” admitted Dorothy,
and without blushing this time.</p>

<p>“No! were you really?” demanded Tavia, eagerly.
“Isn’t it funny he doesn’t write?”</p>

<p>“No. Not at all.”</p>

<p>“But you’d think he would write and thank you
for your letter if nothing more,” urged the argumentative
Tavia.</p>

<p>“No,” said Dorothy again.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>“Because Mr. Knapp never got my letter,”
Dorothy said, opening her bureau drawer and pulling
the letter out from under some things laid
there. “See. It was returned to-day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Dorothy!” gasped Tavia, both startled
and troubled.</p>

<p>“Yes. It—it didn’t reach him somehow,”
Dorothy said, and she could not keep the trouble
entirely out of her voice.</p>

<p>“Oh, my <em>dear</em>!” repeated Tavia.</p>

<p>“And I am sorry,” her friend went on to say;
“for now he will not know about the intentions of
those men, Stiffbold and Lightly.”</p>

<p>“But, goodness! it serves him right,” exclaimed
Tavia, suddenly. “He didn’t give us his right address.”</p>

<p>“He gave us no address,” said Dorothy, sadly.</p>

<p>“Why, yes! he said Desert City——”</p>

<p>“He mentioned that place and said that his land
was somewhere near there. But he works on a
ranch, which, perhaps, is a long way from Desert
City.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” grumbled Tavia. “I forgot he’s
only a cowboy.”</p>

<p>At this Dorothy flushed a little and Tavia,
looking at her sideways and eagerly, noted the
flush. Her eyes danced for a moment, for the girl
was naturally chock-full of mischief.</p>

<p>But in a moment the expression of Tavia Travers’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
face changed. Dorothy was pensively gazing
in the glass; she had halted in her hair brushing,
and Tavia knew that her chum neither saw her
own reflection nor anything else pictured in the
mirror. The mirror of her mind held Dorothy’s
attention, and Tavia could easily guess the vision
there. A tall, broad-shouldered, broad-hatted
young man with a frank and handsome face and
a ready smile that dimpled one bronzed cheek ever
so little and wrinkled the outer corners of his clear,
far-seeing eyes.</p>

<p>Garry Knapp!</p>

<p>Tavia for the first time realized that Dorothy
had found interest and evidently a deep and abiding
interest, in the young stranger from Desert
City. It rather shocked her. Dorothy, of all
persons, to become so very deeply interested in a
man about whom they knew practically nothing.</p>

<p>Tavia suddenly realized that she knew more
about him than Dorothy did. At least, she had
been with Garry Knapp more than had her friend.
It was Tavia who had had the two hours’ tête-à-tête
with the Westerner at dinner on the evening
before Garry Knapp departed so suddenly for the
West. All that happened and was said at that
dinner suddenly unrolled like a panorama before
Tavia’s memory.</p>

<p>Why! she could picture it all plainly. She had
been highly delighted herself in the recovery of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
her bag and in listening to Garry’s story of how
it had been returned by the cash-girl’s sister. And,
of course, she had been pleased to be dining alone
with a fine looking young man in a hotel dining-room.
She had rattled on when her turn came to
talk, just as irresponsibly as usual.</p>

<p>Now, in thinking over the occasion, she realized
that the young man from the West had been
a shrewd questioner. He had got her started
upon Dorothy Dale, and before they came to the
little cups of black coffee Tavia had told just about
all she knew regarding her chum.</p>

<p>The reader may be sure that all Tavia said was
to Dorothy’s glory. She had little need to explain
to Garry Knapp what a beautiful character Dorothy
Dale possessed. Tavia had told about Dorothy’s
family, her Aunt Winnie’s wealth, the fortunes
Major Dale now possessed both in the East
and West, and the fact that when Dorothy came
of age, at twenty-one, she would be wealthy in her
own right. She had said all this to a young man
who was struggling along as a cowpuncher on a
Western ranch, and whose patrimony was a piece
of rundown land that he could sell but for a
song, as he admitted himself. “And no chorus
to it!” Tavia thought.</p>

<p>“I’m a bonehead!” she suddenly thought
fiercely. “Nat would say my noodle is solid ivory.
I know now what was the matter with Garry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
Knapp that evening. I know why he rushed up
to me and asked for Dorothy, and was what the
novelists call ‘distrait’ during our dinner. Oh,
what a worm I am! A miserable, squirmy worm!
Ugh!” and the conscience-stricken girl fairly shuddered
at her own reflection in the mirror and
turned away quickly so that Dorothy should not
see her features.</p>

<p>“It’s—it’s the most <em>wonderful</em> thing. And it
began right under my nose, my poor little ‘re-trousered’
nose, as Joe called it the other day, and I
didn’t really see it! I thought it was just a fancy
on Dorothy’s part! And I never thought of
Garry Knapp’s side of it at all! Oh, my heaven!”
groaned Tavia, deep in her own soul. “Why
wasn’t I born with some good sense instead of
good looks? I—I’ve spoiled my chum’s life, perhaps.
Goodness! it can’t be so bad as that.</p>

<p>“Of course, Garry Knapp is just the sort of
fellow who would raise a barrier of Dorothy’s
riches between them. Goodness me!” added the
practical Tavia, “I’d like to see any barrier of
wealth stop <em>me</em> if I wanted a man. I’d shin the
wall in a hurry so as to be on the same side of it
as he was.”</p>

<p>She would have laughed at this fancy had she
not taken a look at Dorothy’s face again.</p>

<p>“Good-night!” she shouted into her chum’s ear,
hugged her tight, kissed her loudly, and ran away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
into her own room. Once there, she cried all the
time she was disrobing, getting into her lacy nightgown,
and pulling down the bedclothes.</p>

<p>Then she did not immediately go to bed. Instead,
she tiptoed back to the connecting door and
closed it softly. She turned on the hanging electric
light over the desk.</p>

<p>“I’ll do it!” she said, with determined mien.
“I’ll write to Lance Petterby.” And she did so.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE SLIDE ON SNAKE HILL</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Joe and Roger marched down at an early breakfast
hour from the upper regions of the big white
house, singing energetically if not melodiously a
pæan of joy:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘The frog he would a-wooing go——</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Bully for you! Bully for all!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The frog he would a-wooing go——</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Bully for all, we say!’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The boys’ determination to reach the low register
of a bullfrog in that “bully for all” line was
very, very funny, especially in Roger’s case, for
his speaking voice was naturally a shrill treble.</p>

<p>Their joy, however, awoke any sleepers there
might have been in the house, and most of them
came to their bedroom doors and peered out.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you blamed little rascals?”
Ned, in a purple bathrobe, demanded.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you boys just as lief sing as to make
that noise?” Nat, in a gray robe, and at his door,
questioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>But he grinned at his small cousins, for it hadn’t
been so long ago that he was just as much of a
boy as they were.</p>

<p>“Hello, kids!” cried Tavia, sticking out a tousled
head from her room. “Tell us: What’s the
good news?”</p>

<p>Jennie Hapgood peered out for an instant, saw
Ned and Nat, and darted back with an exclamatory
“Oh!”</p>

<p>“I—I thought something had happened,” she
faintly said, closing her door all but a crack.</p>

<p>“Something has,” declared Joe.</p>

<p>“What is it, boys?” asked Dorothy, appearing
fully dressed from her room. “The ice?”</p>

<p>“What ice?” demanded Tavia. “Has the iceman
come so early? Tell him to leave a big ten-cent
piece.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” grunted Roger, “there’s a whole lot
more than a ten-cent piece outside, and you’d see
it if you’d put up your shade. The whole world’s
ice-covered.”</p>

<p>“So it is,” Joe agreed.</p>

<p>“There was rain last evening, you know,” Dorothy
said, starting down the lower flight of stairs
briskly. “And then it turned very cold. Everything
is sheathed in ice out-of-doors. Doesn’t the
warm air from the registers feel nice? I <em>do</em> love
dry heat, even if it is more expensive.”</p>

<p>“Bully!” roared Nat, who had darted back to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
run up the shade at one of the windows in his
room. “Look out, girls! it’s great.”</p>

<p>Every twig on every bush and tree and every
fence rail and post were covered with glistening
ice. The sun, just rising red and rosy as though
he had but now come from a vigorous morning
bath, threw his rays in profusion over this fairy
world and made a most spectacular scene for the
young people to look out upon. In an hour all of
them were out of doors to enjoy the spectacle in
a “close up,” as Tavia called it.</p>

<p>“And we all ought to have spectacles!” she exclaimed
a little later. “This glare is blinding, and
we’ll all have blinky, squinty eyes by night.”</p>

<p>“Automobile goggles—for all hands!” exclaimed
Nat. “They’re all smoked glasses, too.
I’ll get ’em,” and he started for the garage.</p>

<p>“But no automobile to-day,” laughed Jennie.
“Think of the skidding on this sheet of ice.” For
the ground was sheathed by Jack Frost, as well
as the trees and bushes and fences.</p>

<p>Joe and Roger, well wrapped up, were just
starting from the back door and Dorothy hailed
them:</p>

<p>“Where away, my hearties? Ahoy!”</p>

<p>“Aw—we’re just going sliding,” said Roger,
stuttering.</p>

<p>“Where?” demanded the determined older sister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>“Snake Hill,” said Joe, shortly. He loved
Dorothy; but this having girls “butting in” all the
time frayed his manly patience.</p>

<p>“Take care and don’t get hurt, boys!” called
Tavia, roguishly, knowing well that the sisterly advice
was on the tip of Dorothy’s tongue and that
it would infuriate the small boys.</p>

<p>“Aw, you——”</p>

<p>Joe did not get any farther, for Nat in passing
gave him a look. But he shrugged his shoulders
and went on with Roger without replying to
Tavia’s advice.</p>

<p>“Oh, what fun!” cried Jennie Hapgood, suddenly.
“Couldn’t <em>we</em> go coasting?”</p>

<p>“Sure we could,” Ned agreed instantly. Lately
he seemed to agree with anything Jennie said and
that without question.</p>

<p>“Tobogganing—oh, my!” cried Tavia, quick
to seize upon a new scheme for excitement and fun.
Then she turned suddenly serious and added: “If
Dorothy will go. Not otherwise.”</p>

<p>Dorothy laughed at her openly. “Why not,
Tavia?” she demanded. “Are you afraid to trust
the boys unless I’m along? I know they are
awful cut-ups.”</p>

<p>“I feel that Jennie and I should be more carefully
chaperoned,” Tavia declared with serious
lips but twinkling eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh! <em>Oh!</em> OH!” in crescendo from Nat, returning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
in time to hear this. “Who needs a ‘bag
o’ bones’——Excuse me! ‘Chaperon,’ I mean?
What’s afoot?”</p>

<p>Just then he slipped on the glare ice at the foot
of the porch steps and went down with a crash.</p>

<p>“You’re not, old man,” cried Ned as the girls
squealed. “I hope you have your shock-absorbers
on. That was a jim-dandy!”</p>

<p>“Did—did it hurt you, Nat?” begged Tavia,
with clasped hands.</p>

<p>“Oh-ugh!” grunted Nat, gingerly arising and
examining the handful of goggles he carried to
see if they were all right. “Every bone in my
body is broken. Gee! that was some smash.”</p>

<p>“Do it again, dear,” Ned teased. “Your
mother didn’t happen to see you and she’s at the
window now.”</p>

<p>“Aw, you go fish!” retorted the younger
brother, for his dignity was hurt if nothing else.
“Wish it had been you.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” sighed Ned. “I’d have done it so
much more gracefully. You see, practice in the
tango and foxtrot, not to mention other and more
intricate dance steps, <em>does</em> help one. And you
never would give proper attention to your dancing,
Sonny.”</p>

<p>“Here!” threatened Nat. “I’ll dance one of
my fists off your ear——”</p>

<p>“I shall have to part you boys,” broke in Dorothy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
“Threatening each other with corporal punishment—and
before the ladies.”</p>

<p>“Why,” declared Ned, hugging his brother in
a bearlike hug as Nat reached his level on the
porch. “He can beat me to death if he likes, the
dear little thing! Come on, ’Thaniel. What do
you say to giving the girls a slide?”</p>

<p>“Heh?” ejaculated Nat. “What do you want
to let ’em slide for? Got sick of ’em so quick?
Where are your manners?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Ned!” groaned Tavia. “Don’t you want
us hanging around any more?”</p>

<p>“I am surprised at Mr. Edward,” Jennie joined
in.</p>

<p>“Gee, Edward,” said Nat, grinning, “but you
do put your foot in your mouth every time you
open it.”</p>

<p>Dorothy laughed at them all, but made no comment.
Despite her late seriousness she was jolly
enough when she was one of the party. And she
agreed to be one to-day.</p>

<p>It was decided to get out Nat’s old “double-ripper,”
see that it was all right, and at once start
for Snake Hill, where the smaller boys had already
gone.</p>

<p>“For this sun is going to melt the ice a good
deal by noon. Of course, it will be only a short
cold snap this time of year,” Dorothy said, with
her usual practical sense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>They were some time in setting out, and it was
not because the girls “prinked,” as Tavia pointed
out.</p>

<p>“I’d have you know we have been waiting five
whole minutes,” she proclaimed when Ned and
Nat drew the long, rusty-ironed, double-ripper sled
out of the barn. “For once you boys cannot complain.”</p>

<p>“Those kids had been trying to use this big sled,
I declare,” Nat said. “And I had to find a couple
of new bolts. Don’t want to break down on the
hill and spill you girls.”</p>

<p>“That would be spilling the beans for fair,”
Ned put in. “Oh, beg pardon! Be-ings, I mean.
Get aboard, beautiful beings, and we’ll drag you
to the foot of the hill.”</p>

<p>They went on down the back road and into the
woods with much merriment. The foot of Snake
Hill was a mile and a half from The Cedars.
Part of the hill was rough and wild, and there
was not a farm upon its side anywhere.</p>

<p>“I wonder where the kids are making their
slide?” said Tavia, easily.</p>

<p>“That’s why I am glad we came this way,”
Dorothy confessed. “They might be tempted to
slide down on this steep side, instead of going
over to the Washington Village road. <em>That’s</em>
smooth.”</p>

<p>“Trust the boys for finding the most dangerous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
place,” Jennie Hapgood remarked. “I never
saw their like.”</p>

<p>“That’s because you only have an older
brother,” said Dorothy, wisely. “He was past
his reckless age while you were still in pinafores
and pigtails.”</p>

<p>“Reckless age!” scoffed Tavia. “When does
a boy or a man ever cease to be reckless?”</p>

<p>“Right-oh!” agreed Nat, looking back along the
towline of the sled. “See how he forever puts
himself within the danger zone of pretty girls.
Gee! but Ned and I are a reckless team! What
say, Neddie?”</p>

<p>“I say do your share of the pulling,” returned
his brother. “Those girls are no feather-weights,
and this is up hill.”</p>

<p>“Oh, to be so insulted!” murmured Tavia.
“To accuse us of bearing extra flesh about with us
when we all follow Lovely Lucy Larriper’s directions,
given in the <cite>Evening Bazoo</cite>. Not a pound
of the superfluous do we carry.”</p>

<p>“Dorothy’s getting chunky,” announced Nat,
wickedly.</p>

<p>“You’re another!” cried Tavia, standing up for
her chum. “Her lovely curves are to be praised—oh!”</p>

<p>At that moment the young men ran the runners
on one side of the sled over an ice-covered stump,
and the girls all joined in Tavia’s scream. If there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
had not been handholds they would all three have
been ignominiously dumped off.</p>

<p>“Pardon, ladies! Watch your step!” Ned said.
“And don’t get us confused with your ‘beauty-talks’
business. Besides, it isn’t really modest. I always
blush myself when I inadvertently turn over
to the woman’s page of the evening paper. It is
a delicate place for mere man to tread.”</p>

<p>“Hooray!” ejaculated his brother, making a
false step himself just then. “Wish I had creepers
on. <em>This</em> is a mighty delicate place for a fellow
to tread, too, my boy.”</p>

<p>In fact, they soon had to order the girls off the
sled. The way was becoming too steep and the
side of the hill was just as slick as the highway
had been.</p>

<p>With much laughter and not a few terrified
“squawks,” to quote Tavia, the girls scrambled
up the slope after the boys and the sled. Suddenly
piercing screams came from above them.</p>

<p>“Those rascals!” ejaculated Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh! they <em>are</em> sliding on this side,” cried Dorothy.
“Stop them, Ned! Please, Nat!”</p>

<p>“What do you expect us to do?” demanded the
latter. “Run out and catch ’em with our bare
hands?”</p>

<p>They had come to a break in the path now and
could see out over the sloping pasture in which
the boys had been sliding for an hour. Their sled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
had worked a plain path down the hill; but at the
foot of it was an abrupt drop over the side of a
gully. Dorothy Dale—and her cousins, too—knew
that gully very well. There was a cave in
it, and in and about that cave they had once had
some very exciting adventures.</p>

<p>Joe and Roger had selected the smoothest part
of the pasture to coast in, it was true; but the
party of young folk just arrived could see that it
was a very dangerous place as well. At the foot
of the slide was a little bank overhanging the
gully. The smaller boys had been stopping their
sled right on the brink, and with a jolt, for the
watchers could see Joe’s heelprints in the ground
where the ice had been broken away.</p>

<p>They could hear the boys screaming out a school
song at the top of the hill. Ned and Nat roared
a command to Joe and Roger to halt in their mad
career; but the two smaller boys were making so
much noise that it was evident their cousins’ shout
was not heard by them.</p>

<p>They came down, Joe sitting ahead on the sled
with his brother hanging on behind, the feet of the
boy sitting in front thrust out to halt the sled.
But if the sled should jump over the barrier, the
two reckless boys would fall twenty feet to the
bottom of the gully.</p>

<p>“Stop them, do!” groaned Jennie Hapgood,
who was a timid girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>It was Dorothy who looked again at the little
mound on the edge of gully’s bank. The frost
had got into the earth there, for it had been freezing
weather for several days before the ice storm
of the previous night. Now the sun was shining
full on the spot, and she could see where the boys’
feet, colliding with that lump of earth on the verge
of the declivity, had knocked off the ice and bared
the earth completely. There was, too, a long
crack along the edge of the slight precipice.</p>

<p>“Oh, boys!” she called to Ned and Nat, who
were struggling up the hill once more, “stop them,
do! You must! That bank is crumbling away.
If they come smashing down upon it again they
may go over the brink, sled and all!”</p>

<span class="fs80">THE FLY IN THE AMBER</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Oh, Dorothy!” cried Tavia.</p>

<p>Jennie, with a shudder, buried her face in her
hands.</p>

<p>Joe and Roger Dale were fairly flying down the
hill, and would endeavor to stop by collision with
the same lump of frozen earth that had previously
been their bulwark.</p>

<p>“See! Ned! Nat!” cried Dorothy again. “We
must stop them!”</p>

<p>But how stop the boys already rushing down
hill on their coaster? It seemed an impossible
feat.</p>

<p>The White brothers dropped the towline of the
big sled and scrambled along the slippery slope
toward the edge of the gully.</p>

<p>With a whoop of delight the two smaller boys,
on their red coaster, whisked past the girls.</p>

<p>“Stop them!” shrieked the three in chorus.</p>

<p>Ned reached the edge of the gully bank first.
His weight upon the cracking earth sent the slight
barrier crashing over the brink. Just as they had
supposed there was not a possible chance of Joe’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
stopping the sled when it came down to this perilous
spot.</p>

<p>Tavia groaned and wrung her hands. Jennie
burst out crying. Dorothy knew she could not
help, yet she staggered after Ned and Nat, unable
to remain inactive like the other girls.</p>

<p>Ned recovered himself from the slippery edge
of the bank; but by a hair’s breadth only was he
saved from being thrown to the bottom of the
gully. He crossed the slide in a bound and
whirled swiftly, gesturing to his brother to stay
back. Nat understood and stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>“You grab Roger—I’ll take Joe!” panted Ned.</p>

<p>Just then the smaller boys on the sled rushed
down upon them. Fortunately, the steeper part
of the hill ended some rods back from the gully’s
edge. But the momentum the coaster had gained
brought it and its burden of surprised and yelling
boys at a very swift pace, indeed, down to the
point where Ned and Nat stood bracing themselves
upon the icy ground.</p>

<p>“Oh, boys!” shrieked Tavia, without understanding
what Ned and Nat hoped to accomplish.
“<em>Do something!</em>”</p>

<p>And the very next instant they did!</p>

<p>The coaster came shooting down to the verge
of the gully bank. Joe Dale saw that the bank
had given way and he could not stop the sled.
Nor did he dare try to swerve it to one side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>Ned and Nat, staring at the imperilled coasters,
saw the look of fear come into Joe’s face.
Ned shouted:</p>

<p>“Let go all holds! We’ll grab you! Quick!”</p>

<p>Joe was a quick-minded boy after all. He was
holding the steering lines. Roger was clinging to
his shoulders. If Joe dropped the lines, both boys
would be free of the sled.</p>

<p>That is what he did. Ned swooped and
grabbed Joe. Nat seized upon the shrieking and
surprised Roger. The sled darted out from beneath
the two boys and shot over the verge of the
bank, landing below in the gully with a crash
among the icy branches of a tree.</p>

<p>“Wha—what did you do that for?” Roger demanded
of Nat, as the latter set him firmly on his
feet.</p>

<p>“Just for instance, kid,” growled Nat. “We
ought to have let you both go.”</p>

<p>“And I guess we would if it hadn’t been for
Dorothy,” added Ned, rising from where he had
fallen with Joe on top of him.</p>

<p>“Cracky!” gasped Joe. “We’d have gone
straight over that bank that time, wouldn’t we?
Gee, Roger! we’d have broken our necks!”</p>

<p>Even Roger was impressed by this stated fact.
“Oh, Dorothy!” he cried, “isn’t it lucky you happened
along, so’s to tell Ned and Nat what to do?
I wouldn’t care to have a broken neck.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>“You are very right, kid,” growled Nat. “It’s
Dorothy ‘as does it’—always. She is the observant
little lady who puts us wise to every danger.
‘Who ran to catch me when I fell?’ My cousin!”</p>

<p>“Hold your horses, son,” advised his brother,
with seriousness. “It was Dorothy who smelled
out the danger all right.”</p>

<p>“I do delight in the metaphors you boys use,”
broke in Dorothy. “I might be a beagle-hound,
according to Ned. ‘Smelled out,’ indeed!”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you horrid?” sighed Jennie, for they
were all toiling up the hill again.</p>

<p>Ned put the cup of his hand under Jennie’s
elbow and helped her over a particularly glary
spot. “Boys are very good folk,” he said, smiling
down into her pretty face, “if you take them just
right. But they are explosive, of course.”</p>

<p>Nat, likewise helping to drag the big sled, was
walking beside Tavia. Dorothy looked from one
couple to the other, smiled, and then found that
her eyes were misty.</p>

<p>“Why!” she gasped under her breath, “I believe
I am getting to be a sour old maid. I am
jealous!”</p>

<p>She turned her attention to the smaller boys and
they all went gaily up the hill. Nobody was going
to discover that Dorothy Dale felt blue—not if
she could possibly help it!</p>

<p>Over on the other side of the hill where the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
smooth road lay the party had a wonderfully invigorating
coasting time. They all piled upon the
double-ripper—Joe and Roger, too—and after
the first two or three slides, the runners became
freed of rust and the heavy sled fairly flew.</p>

<p>“Oh! this is great—great!” cried Tavia. “It’s
just like flying. I always did want to fly up into
the blue empyrean——”</p>

<p>They were then resting at the top of the hill.
Nat turned over on his back upon the sled,
struggled with all four limbs, and uttered a soul-searching:
“Woof! woof! Ow-row-row! Woof!”</p>

<p>“Get up, silly!” ordered Tavia. “Whenever I
have any flight of fancy <em>you</em> always make it fall
flat.”</p>

<p>“And if you tried a literal flight into the empyrean—ugh!—you’d
fall flat without any help,”
declared Nat. “But we don’t want you to fly
away from us, Tavia. We couldn’t get along
without you.”</p>

<p>“‘Thank you, kindly, sir, she said,’” responded
his gay little friend.</p>

<p>However, Tavia and Nat could be serious on
occasion. This very day as the party tramped
home to luncheon, dragging the sleds, having recovered
the one from the gully, they walked apart,
and Dorothy noted they were preoccupied. But
then, so were Ned and Jennie. Dorothy’s eyes
danced now. She had recovered her poise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>“It’s great fun,” she whispered to her aunt,
when they were back in the house. “Watching
people who are pairing off, I mean. I know ‘which
is which’ all right now. And I guess you do, too,
Aunt Winnie?”</p>

<p>Mrs. White nodded and smiled. There was
nothing to fear regarding this intimacy between
her big sons and Dorothy’s pretty friends. Indeed,
she could wish for no better thing to happen
than that Ned and Nat should become interested
in Tavia and Jennie.</p>

<p>“But you, my dear?” she asked Dorothy, slyly.
“Hadn’t we better be finding somebody for you
to walk and talk with?”</p>

<p>“I must play chaperon,” declared Dorothy,
gaily. “No, no! I am going to be an old maid,
I tell you, Auntie dear.” And to herself she
added: “But never a sour, disagreeable, jealous
one! Never <em>that</em>!”</p>

<p>Not that in secret Dorothy did not have many
heavy thoughts when she remembered Garry
Knapp or anything connected with him.</p>

<p>“We must send those poor girls some Christmas
remembrances,” Dorothy said to Tavia, and
Tavia understood whom she meant without having
it explained to her.</p>

<p>“Of course we will,” she cried. “You would
not let me give Forty-seven and her sister as much
money as I wanted to for finding my bag.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>“No. I don’t think it does any good to put a
premium on honesty,” Dorothy said gravely.</p>

<p>“Huh! that’s just what Garry Knapp said,”
said Tavia, reflectively.</p>

<p>“But now,” Dorothy hastened to add, “we can
send them both at Christmas time something really
worth while.”</p>

<p>“Something warm to wear,” said Tavia, more
than ordinarily thoughtful. “They have to go
through the cold streets to work in all weathers.”</p>

<p>It seemed odd, but Dorothy noticed that her
chum remained rather serious all that day. In
the evening Nat came in with the mail bag and
dumped its contents on the hall table. This was
just before dinner and usually the cry of “Mail!”
up the stairway brought most of the family into
the big entrance hall.</p>

<p>Down tripped Tavia with the other girls; Ned
lounged in from the library; Joe and Roger appeared,
although they seldom had any letters, only
funny postal cards from their old-time chums at
Dalton and from local school friends.</p>

<p>Mrs. White took her mail off to her own room.
She walked without her crutch now, but favored
the lame ankle. Joe seized upon his father’s mail
and ran to find him.</p>

<p>Nat sorted the letters out swiftly. Everybody
had a few. Suddenly he hesitated as he picked
up a rather coarse envelope on which Tavia’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
name was scrawled. In the upper left-hand corner
was written: “L. Petterby.”</p>

<p>“Great Peter!” he gasped, shooting a questioning
glance at Tavia. “Does that cowpuncher write
to you still?”</p>

<p>Perhaps there was something like an accusation
in Nat’s tone. At least, it was not just the
tone to take with such a high-spirited person as
Tavia. Her head came up and her eyes flashed.
She reached for the letter.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that nice!” she cried. “Another from
dear old Lance. He’s <em>such</em> a desperately determined
chap.”</p>

<p>At first the other young folk had not noted
Nat’s tone or Tavia’s look. But the young man’s
next query all understood:</p>

<p>“Still at it, are you, Tavia? Can’t possibly
keep from stringing ’em along? It’s meat and
drink to you, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course,” drawled Tavia, two red
spots in her cheeks.</p>

<p>She walked away, slitting Lance Petterby’s envelope
as she went. Nat’s brow was clouded, and
all through dinner he said very little. Tavia
seemed livelier and more social than ever, but
Dorothy apprehended “the fly in the amber.”</p>

<span class="fs80">“DO YOU UNDERSTAND TAVIA?”</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“You got this old timer running round in circles,
Miss Tavia, when you ask about a feller
named Garford Knapp anywhere in this latitude,
and working for a feller named Bob. There’s
more ‘Bobs’ running ranches out here than there
is bobwhites down there East where you live. Too
bad you can’t remember this here Bob’s last name,
or his brand.</p>

<p>“Now, come to think, there was a feller named
‘Dimples’ Knapp used to be found in Desert City,
but not in Hardin. And you ought to see Hardin—it’s
growing some!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>This was a part of what was in Lance Petterby’s
letter. Had Nat White been allowed to read
it he would have learned something else—something
that not only would have surprised him and
his brother and cousin, but would have served to
burn away at once the debris of trouble that
seemed suddenly heaped between Tavia and himself.</p>

<p>It was true that Tavia had kept up her correspondence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
with the good-natured and good-looking
cowboy in whom, while she was West, she had
become interested, and that against the advice of
Dorothy Dale. She did this for a reason deeper
than mere mischief.</p>

<p>Lance Petterby had confided in her more than
in any of the other Easterners of the party that
had come to the big Hardin ranch. Lance was in
love with a school teacher of the district while the
party from the East was at Hardin; and now he
had been some months married to the woman of
his choice.</p>

<p>When Tavia read bits of his letters, even to
Dorothy, she skipped all mention of Lance’s romance
and his marriage. This she did, it is true,
because of a mischievous desire to plague her chum
and Ned and Nat. Of late, since affairs had become
truly serious between Nat and herself, she
would have at any time explained the joke to Nat
had she thought of it, or had he asked her about
Lance.</p>

<p>The very evening previous to the arrival of this
letter from the cowpuncher to which Nat had so
unwisely objected, Nat and Tavia had gone for
a walk together in the crisp December moonlight
and had talked very seriously.</p>

<p>Nat, although as full of fun as Tavia herself,
could be grave; and he made his intention and his
desires very plain to the girl. Tavia would not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
show him all that was in her heart. That was not
her way. She was always inclined to hide her
deeper feelings beneath a light manner and light
words. But she was brave and she was honest.
When he pinned her right down to the question,
yes or no, Tavia looked courageously into Nat’s
eyes and said:</p>

<p>“Yes, Nat. <em>I do.</em> But somebody besides you
must ask me before I will agree to—to ‘make you
happy’ as you call it.”</p>

<p>“For the good land’s sake!” gasped Nat.
“Who’s business is it but ours? If you love me
as I love you——”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” interrupted Tavia, with laughter
breaking forth. “‘No knife can cut our love
in two.’ But, <em>dear</em>——”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tavia!”</p>

<p>“Wait, honey,” she whispered, with her face
close pressed against his shoulder. “No! don’t
kiss me now. You’ve kissed me before—in fun.
The next time you kiss me it must be in solemn
earnest.”</p>

<p>“By heaven, girl!” exclaimed Nat, hoarsely.
“Do you think I am fooling now?”</p>

<p>“No, boy,” she whispered, looking up at him
again suddenly. “But somebody else must ask
me before I have a right to promise what you
want.”</p>

<p>“Who?” demanded Nat, in alarm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>“You know that I am a poor girl. Not only
that, but I do not come from the same stock that
you do. There is no blue blood in my veins,”
and she uttered a little laugh that might have
sounded bitter had there not been the tremor of
tears in it.</p>

<p>“What nonsense, Tavia!” the young man cried,
shaking her gently by the shoulders.</p>

<p>“Oh no, Nat! Wait! I am a poor girl and I
come of very, very common stock. I don’t mean
I am ashamed of my poverty, or of the fact that
my father and mother both sprang from the laboring
class.</p>

<p>“But you might be expected when you marry
to take for a wife a girl from a family whose
forebears were <em>something</em>. Mine were not.
Why, one of my grandfathers was an immigrant
and dug ditches——”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! I had a relative who dug a ditch, too.
In Revolutionary times——”</p>

<p>“That is it exactly,” Tavia hastened to say.
“I know about him. He helped dig the breastworks
on Breeds Hill and was wounded in the
Battle of Bunker Hill. I know all about that.
Your people were Pilgrim and Dutch stock.”</p>

<p>“Immigrants, too,” said Nat, muttering. “And
maybe some of them left their country across the
seas for their country’s good.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter,” said the shrewd Tavia.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
“Being an immigrant in America in sixteen hundred
is one thing. Being an immigrant in the latter
end of the nineteenth century is an entirely
different pair of boots.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tavia!”</p>

<p>“No. Your mother has been as kind to me—and
for years and years—as though I were her
niece, too, instead of just one of Dorothy’s friends.
She may have other plans for her sons, Nat.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!”</p>

<p>“I will not answer you,” the girl cried, a little
wildly now, and began to sob. “Oh, Nat! Nat!
I have thought of this so much. Your mother
must ask me, or I can never tell you what I want
to tell you!”</p>

<p>Nat respected her desire and did not kiss her
although she clung, sobbing, to him for some moments.
But after she had wiped away her tears
and had begun to joke again in her usual way, they
went back to the house.</p>

<p>And Nat White knew he was walking on air!
He could not feel the path beneath his feet.</p>

<p>He was obliged to go to town early the next
morning, and when he returned, as we have seen,
just before dinner, he brought the mail bag up
from the North Birchland post-office.</p>

<p>He could not understand Tavia’s attitude regarding
Lance Petterby’s letter, and he was both
hurt and jealous. Actually he was jealous!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>“Do you understand Tavia?” he asked his
cousin Dorothy, right after dinner.</p>

<p>“My dear boy,” Dorothy Dale said, “I never
claimed to be a seer. <em>Who</em> understands Tavia—fully?”</p>

<p>“But you know her better than anybody else.”</p>

<p>“Better than Tavia knows herself, perhaps,”
admitted Dorothy.</p>

<p>“Well, see here! I’ve asked her to marry
me——”</p>

<p>“Oh, Nat! my dear boy! I am so glad!” Dorothy
cried, and she kissed her cousin warmly.</p>

<p>“Don’t be so hasty with your congratulations,”
growled Nat, still red and fuming. “She didn’t
tell me ‘yes.’ I don’t know now that I want her
to. I want to know what she means, getting letters
from that fellow out West.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Nat!” sighed Dorothy, looking at him
levelly. “Are you <em>sure</em> you love her?”</p>

<p>He said nothing more, and Dorothy did not
add a word. But Tavia waited in vain that evening
for Mrs. White to come to her and ask the
question which she had told Nat his mother must
ask for him.</p>

</div>

<p>Tavia was as loyal a girl as ever stepped in
shoe-leather. That was an oft-repeated expression
of Major Dale’s. He loved “the flyaway”
for this very attribute.</p>

<p>Tavia was now attempting to bring joy and
happiness for Dorothy out of chaos. Therefore,
she felt she dared take nobody into her confidence
regarding Lance Petterby’s letter.</p>

<p>She replied to Lance at once, explaining more
fully about Garry Knapp, the land he was about
to sell, and the fact that Eastern schemers were
trying to obtain possession of Knapp’s ranch for
wheat land and at a price far below its real worth.</p>

<p>Satisfaction, Tavia might feel in this attempt to
help Dorothy; but everything else in the world
was colored blue—very blue, indeed!</p>

<p>When one’s ear has become used to the clatter
of a noisy little windmill, for instance, and the
wind suddenly ceases and it remains calm, the cessation
of the mill’s clatter is almost a shock to the
nerves.</p>

<p>This was about the way Tavia’s sudden shift of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
manner struck all those observant ones at The
Cedars. As the season of joy and gladness and
good-will approached, Tavia Travers sank lower
and lower into a Slough of Despond.</p>

<p>Had it not been for Dorothy Dale, the others
must have audibly remarked Tavia’s lack of
sparkle. Though Dorothy did not imagine that
Tavia was engaged in any attempt to help her,
and because of that attempt had refused to explain
Lance Petterby’s letter to Nat White, yet
she loyally began to act as a buffer between the
others and the contrary Tavia. More than once
did Dorothy fly to Tavia’s rescue when she seemed
to be in difficulties.</p>

<p>Tavia had a streak of secrecy in her character
that sometimes placed her in a bad light when
judged by unknowing people. Dorothy, however,
felt sure that on this present occasion there was
no real fault to be found with her dear friend.</p>

<p>Nat refused to speak further about his feeling
toward Tavia; Dorothy knew better than to try
to tempt Tavia herself to explain. The outstanding
difficulty was the letter from the Westerner.
Feeling sure, as she did, that Tavia liked
Nat immensely and really cared nothing for any
other man, Dorothy refrained from hinting at the
difficulty to her chum. Let matters take their
course. That was the better way, Dorothy believed.
She felt that Nat’s deeper affections had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
been moved and that only the surface of his pride
and jealousy were nicked. On the other hand she
knew Tavia to be a most loyal soul, and she could
not imagine that there was really any cause, other
than mischief, for Tavia to allow that letter to
stand between Nat and herself.</p>

<p>To smooth over the rough edges and hide any
unpleasantness from the observation of the older
members of the family, Dorothy became very active
in the social life of The Cedars again. No
longer did she refuse to attend the cousins and
Jennie and Tavia in any venture. It was a quintette
of apparently merry young people once
more; never a quartette. Nor were Nat and
Tavia seen alone together during those few short
weeks preceding Christmas.</p>

<p>Secretly, Dorothy was very unhappy over the
misunderstanding between her chum and Nat.
That it was merely a disagreement and would not
cause a permanent break between the two was her
dear hope. For she wished to see them both
happy. Although at one time she thought the
steadier Ned, the older cousin, might be a better
mate for her flyaway friend, she had come to see
it differently of late. If anybody could understand
and properly appreciate Tavia Travers it
was Nathaniel White. His mind, too, was quick,
his imagination colorful. Dorothy Dale, with
growing understanding of character and the mental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
equipment to judge her associates better than
most girls, or young women, of her age, believed
in her heart that neither Tavia nor Nat would ever
get along with any other companion as well as the
two could get along together.</p>

<p>The two “wildfires,” as Aunt Winnie sometimes
called them, had always had occasional bickerings.
But a dispute is like a thunderstorm—it usually
clears the air.</p>

<p>Nor did Dorothy doubt for a moment that her
cousin and her friend were deeply in love now, the
one with the other. That Tavia had turned without
explanation about Lance Petterby’s letter from
Nat and that the latter had told Dorothy he was
not sure he wished Tavia to answer the important
question he had put to her, sprang only from
pique on Nat’s side, and, Dorothy was sure, from
something much the same in her chum’s heart.</p>

<p>Light-minded and frivolous as Tavia had always
appeared, Dorothy knew well that the undercurrent
of her chum’s feelings was both deep
and strong. Where she gave affection Tavia herself
would have said she “loved hard!”</p>

<p>Dorothy had watched, during these past few
weeks especially, the intimacy grow between her
chum and Nat White. They were bound to each
other, Dorothy believed, by many ties. Disagreements
did not count. All that was on the surface.
Underneath, the tide of their feelings intermingled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
and flowed together. She could not believe that
any little misunderstanding could permanently divide
Tavia and Nat.</p>

<p>But they were at cross purposes—that was
plain. Nat was irritated and Tavia was proud.
Dorothy knew that her chum was just the sort of
person to be hurt most by being doubted.</p>

<p>Nat should have understood that if Tavia had
given him reason to believe she cared for him, her
nature was so loyal that in no particular could she
be unfaithful to the trust he placed in her. His
quick appearance of doubt when he saw the letter
from the West had hurt Tavia cruelly.</p>

<p>Yet, Dorothy Dale did not try to make peace
between the two by going to Nat and putting these
facts before him in the strong light of good sense.
She was quite sure that if she did so Nat would
come to terms and beg Tavia’s pardon. That was
Nat’s way. He never took a middle course. He
must be either at one extreme of the pendulum’s
swing or the other.</p>

<p>And Dorothy was sure that it would not be
well, either for Nat or for Tavia, for the former
to give in without question and shoulder the entire
responsibility for this lover’s quarrel. For
to Dorothy Dale’s mind there was a greater shade
of fault upon her chum’s side of the controversy
than there was on Nat’s. Because of the very
fact that all her life Tavia had been flirting or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
making believe to flirt, there was some reason for
Nat’s show of spleen over the Petterby letter.</p>

<p>Dorothy did not know what had passed between
Tavia and Nat the evening before the arrival of
the letter. She did not know what Tavia had
demanded of Nat before she would give him the
answer he craved.</p>

<p>Nat kept silence. Mrs. White did not come to
Tavia and ask the question which meant so much
to the warm-hearted girl. Tavia suffered in every
fiber of her being, but would not betray her feelings.
And Dorothy waited her chance to say
something to her chum that might help to clear
up the unfortunate state of affairs.</p>

<p>So all were at cross purposes, and gradually
the good times at The Cedars became something
of a mockery.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX<br>
<span class="fs80">WEDDING BELLS IN PROSPECT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Four days before Christmas Dorothy Dale,
her cousins, and Tavia all boarded the train with
Jennie Hapgood, bound for the latter’s home in
Pennsylvania. On Christmas Eve Jennie’s brother
Jack was to be married, and he had written jointly
with the young lady who was to be “Mrs. Jack”
after that date, that the ceremony could not possibly
take place unless the North Birchland crowd
of young folk crossed the better part of two
states, to be “in at the finish.”</p>

<p>“Goodness me,” drawled Tavia, when this letter
had come from Sunnyside Farm. “He talks
as though wedded bliss were something like a
sentence to the penitentiary. How horrid!”</p>

<p>“It is. For a lot of us men,” Nat said, grinning.
“No more stag parties with the fellows for
one thing. Cut out half the time one might spend
at the club. And then, there is the pocket peril.”</p>

<p>“The—the <em>what</em>?” demanded Jennie. “What
under the sun is that?”</p>

<p>“A new one on me,” said Ned. “Out with it.
’Thaniel. What is the ‘pocket peril’?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>“Why, after a fellow is married they tell me
that he never knows when he puts his hand in his
pocket whether he will find money there or not.
Maybe Friend Wife has beaten him to it.”</p>

<p>“For shame!” cried Dorothy. “You certainly
deserve never to know what Tavia calls ’wedded
bliss.’”</p>

<p>“I have my doubts as to my ever doing so,”
muttered Nat, his face suddenly expressing gloom;
and he marched away.</p>

<p>Jennie and Ned did not observe this. Indeed,
it was becoming so with them that they saw nobody
but each other. Their infatuation was so
plain that sometimes it was really funny. Yet
even Tavia, with her sharp tongue, spared the
happy couple any gibes. Sometimes when she
looked at them her eyes were bright with moisture.
Dorothy saw this, if nobody else did.</p>

<p>However, the trip to western Pennsylvania was
very pleasant, indeed. Dorothy posed as chaperon,
and the boys voted that she made an excellent
one.</p>

<p>The party got off gaily; but after a while Ned
and Jennie slipped away to the observation platform,
cold as the weather was, and Nat plainly
felt ill at ease with his cousin and Tavia. He
grumbled something about Ned having become
“an old poke,” and sauntered into another car,
leaving Tavia alone with Dorothy Dale in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
compartment. Almost at once Dorothy said to
her chum:</p>

<p>“Tavia, dear, are you going to let this thing go
on, and become worse and worse?”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” demanded Tavia, a little tartly.</p>

<p>“This misunderstanding between you and Nat?
Aren’t you risking your own happiness as well as
his?”</p>

<p>“Dorothy——”</p>

<p>“Don’t be angry, dear,” her chum hastened to
say. “Please don’t. I hate to see both you and
Nat in such a false position.”</p>

<p>“How false?” demanded Tavia.</p>

<p>“Because you are neither of you satisfied with
yourselves. You are both wrong, perhaps; but
I think that under the circumstances you, dear,
should put forth the first effort for reconciliation.”</p>

<p>“With Nat?” gasped Tavia.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Not to save my life!” cried her friend.
“Never!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tavia!”</p>

<p>“You take his side because of that letter,”
Tavia said accusingly. “Well, if <em>that’s</em> the idea,
here’s another letter from Lance!” and she opened
her bag and produced an envelope on which appeared
the cowboy’s scrawling handwriting. Dorothy
knew it well.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tavia!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t ‘Oh, Tavia’ me!” exclaimed the other
girl, her eyes bright with anger. “Nobody has
a right to choose my correspondents for me.”</p>

<p>“You know that all the matter is with Nat, he
is jealous,” Dorothy said frankly.</p>

<p>“What right has he to be?” demanded Tavia
in a hard voice, but looking away quickly.</p>

<p>“Dear,” said Dorothy softly, laying her hand
on Tavia’s arm, “he told me he—he asked you
to marry him.”</p>

<p>“He never!”</p>

<p>“But you knew that was what he meant,” Dorothy
said shrewdly.</p>

<p>Tavia was silent, and her friend went on to
say:</p>

<p>“You know he thinks the world of you, dear.
If he didn’t he would not have been angered. And
I do think—considering everything—that you
ought not to continue to let that fellow out West
write to you——”</p>

<p>Tavia turned on her with hard, flashing eyes.
She held out the letter, saying in a voice quite
different from her usual tone:</p>

<p>“I want you to read this letter—but only on
condition that you say nothing to Nat White about
it, not a word! Do you understand, Dorothy
Dale?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Dorothy, wondering. “I do <em>not</em>
understand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>“You understand that I am binding you to
secrecy, at least,” Tavia continued in the same
tone.</p>

<p>“Why—yes—<em>that</em>,” admitted her friend.</p>

<p>“Very well, then, read it,” said Tavia and
turned to look out of the window while Dorothy
withdrew the closely written, penciled pages from
the envelope and unfolded them.</p>

<p>In a moment Dorothy cried aloud:</p>

<p>“Oh, Tavia! you wrote him about Mr. Knapp!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Tavia.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear! is <em>that</em> why he wrote you the
other time? Of course! And he says he can’t find
him. Dimples Knapp he calls him. Oh, my
dear!”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Tavia, in the same gruff voice.
“Read on.” She did not turn from the window.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tavia!” Dorothy said in a moment or
two. “Those men are out there buying up wheat
lands—Stiffbold and Lightly. Lance says he has
met them.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid your friend, ‘Garry Owen,’ will be
beat,” said Tavia, shrugging her shoulders. “Do
you see what Lance says next?”</p>

<p>“He thinks he may get word of this Knapp he
knows in a few days. Thinks he may be working
for a man named Robert Douglas. Oh, Tavia!
Of course he is! That is the name of his employer!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>But Tavia displayed very little interest. “I had
forgotten,” she said.</p>

<p>“Bob Douglas! Of course you remember!
And Lance says he’ll get word to him and tip
him off, as he calls it, about the land-sharks. Oh,
Tavia!”</p>

<p>Her friend still looked out of the window.
Dorothy shook her by the elbow, staring at the
written lines of Lance Petterby’s letter.</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” she demanded.
“‘Sue sends her best, and so does Ma.’ Who is
Sue?”</p>

<p>“Why, that is Mrs. Petterby, the younger,”
drawled Tavia, flashing a glance at Dorothy.</p>

<p>“Married?” gasped Dorothy.</p>

<p>“According to law,” responded Tavia, solemnly.
“And worse. Read on.”</p>

<p>Breathlessly, Dorothy Dale consumed the remainder
of the letter. Some of it she murmured
aloud:</p>

<p>“‘The kid is a wonder. You’d ought to see
her. Two weeks old to-day and I bet she could
sit a bucking pony. You’re elected godmother,
Miss Tavia, because she is going to be called ‘Octavia
Susan Petterby,’ believe me!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tavia!” finished Dorothy, crumpling the
letter in her hand. “And you never told us a word
about it. <em>That’s</em> why you wanted to buy a silver
mug!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” Tavia admitted.</p>

<p>“And they have been married how long?”</p>

<p>“Almost a year. Soon after we came away
from Hardin.”</p>

<p>“And you never said a word,” Dorothy said
accusingly. “We all supposed——”</p>

<p>“That I was flirting with poor old Lance.
Yes,” said Tavia, her eyes and voice both hard.</p>

<p>“And why shouldn’t we think so?” asked Dorothy,
quietly. “You do so many queer things. Or
you <em>used</em> to.”</p>

<p>“I don’t now,” said her friend, bruskly.</p>

<p>“No. But how were we to know? How was
Nat to know?” she added.</p>

<p>Then Tavia turned on her with excitement.
“You promised not to tell!” she said. “Don’t you
<em>dare</em> let Nat White know about this letter!”</p>

<span class="fs80">A GIRL OF TO-DAY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“It was the prettiest wedding I ever saw,”
Dorothy Dale declared, as the party, bound for
North Birchland again, climbed aboard the midnight
train at the station nearest Sunnyside Farm.</p>

<p>“And the bride was too sweet for anything,”
added Jennie Hapgood, who was returning to The
Cedars as agreed, to remain until after New
Year’s.</p>

<p>“Jack looked quite as they always do,” said
Ned in a hollow voice.</p>

<p>“As who always do?” demanded Tavia.</p>

<p>“The brooms.”</p>

<p>“‘Brooms’!” cried Dorothy. “Grooms, Ned?”</p>

<p>“He’s a ‘new broom’ all right,” chuckled Edward
White. “Poor chap! he doesn’t know what
it means to love, honor, obey, and buy frocks and
hats for a girl of to-day.”</p>

<p>“Pah!” retorted his brother, “you’d like to be
in his shoes, Nedward.”</p>

<p>“Me? I—guess—not!” declared Edward.
“I have my own shoes to stand in, thank you,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
and Ned looked at Jennie Hapgood with a meaning
air.</p>

<p>So the party came back to The Cedars in much
the same state as it had gone to the wedding. Ned
and Jennie were so much taken up with each other
that they were frankly oblivious to the mutual attitude
of Nat and Tavia. Dorothy Dale was kept
busy warding off happenings that might attract the
particular attention of Major Dale and Aunt Winnie
to the real situation between the two.</p>

<p>Besides, Dorothy had “troubles of her own,”
as the saying goes. She felt that she must decide,
and neglect the decision no longer, a very, very
important matter that concerned herself more than
it did anybody else in the world—a matter that
she was selfishly interested in.</p>

<p>Ample time had passed now for Dorothy Dale
to consider from all standpoints this really wonderful
thing that had come into her life and had
so changed her outlook. On the surface she might
seem the same Dorothy Dale to her friends and
relatives; but secretly the whole world was different
to her since that shopping trip she and Tavia
had taken to New York wherein she and her
chum had met Garry Knapp.</p>

<p>A thousand times Dorothy had called up the
details of every incident of the adventure—this
greatest of all adventures Dorothy Dale had
ever entered upon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>She felt that she should never meet again a man
like Garry Knapp. None of the boys she had
known before had ever made much of an impression
on Dorothy Dale’s well-balanced mind.
But from the beginning she had looked upon the
young Westerner with a new vision. His reflection
filled the mirror of her thought as splendidly
as at first. The dimple that showed faintly in one
bronzed cheek, his rather large but well-formed
features, his mop of black hair, his broad shoulders
and well-set-up body—all these personal attributes
belonging to Garry Knapp were as clearly
fixed in Dorothy’s mind now as at first.</p>

<p>So, too, her memory of all that had happened
was clear. Garry’s proffered help in the department
store when Tavia was in trouble first aroused
Dorothy to an appreciation of his unstudied kindness.
It was the most natural thing in the world
for him to offer aid when he saw anybody in
trouble.</p>

<p>Dorothy blushed now whenever she thought of
her doubts of Garry Knapp when she had seen
him so easily fall into conversation with the department
store salesgirl on the street. Why! that
was exactly what he would do—especially if the
girl asked him for help. She still blushed at the
remembrance of the jealous feeling that had
prompted her avoidance of the young man until
his action was explained. Her pique had shortened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
her acquaintanceship with Garry Knapp.
She might have known him far better had it not
been for that incident of the shopgirl.</p>

<p>“And my own suspicion was the cause of it. I
refused to meet Garry Knapp as Tavia did. Why!
she knows him better than I do,” Dorothy Dale
told herself.</p>

<p>It was after her discovery of why Tavia had
been writing to Lance Petterby and receiving answers
from that “happy tho’ married cowboy person,”
to quote Tavia, that Dorothy so searched
her own heart regarding Garry Knapp.</p>

<p>“You are a dear, loyal friend, Tavia,” she told
her chum. “But—but <em>why</em> are you trying so to
get in touch with Mr. Knapp?”</p>

<p>“Really want me to tell you?” demanded Tavia.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Truly-rooly—black-and-bluely?”</p>

<p>“Of course, dear.”</p>

<p>“Because I have been a regular ivory-kopf!”
cried Tavia. “Forgive my hybrid German. Oh,
Dorothy! I didn’t want to tell you, for I hoped
Lance might quickly find your Garry Knapp.”</p>

<p>“<em>My</em> Garry Knapp,” said Dorothy, blushing.</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear. Don’t dodge the fact. We all
seem to be suddenly grown up. We are shucking
our shells of maidenhood like crabs——”</p>

<p>“Tavia! Horrors! Don’t!” begged Dorothy.</p>

<p>“Don’t like my metaphor, dear?” chuckled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
Tavia. But she was grim again in a moment, continuing:
“No use dodging the fact, I repeat. You
were interested in that man from the beginning.
Now, weren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Ye—es, Tavia,” admitted her friend.</p>

<p>“And I should have seen that you were. I
ought to have known, when you were put out with
him because of that shopgirl, that for that very
reason you were more interested in Garry Knapp
than in any other fellow who ever shined up to
you——”</p>

<p>“Tavia! How can you?”</p>

<p>“Huh! Just as e-asy,” responded her friend,
with a wicked twinkle in her eye and mimicking
Garry Knapp’s manner of speaking. “Now, listen!”
she hurried on. “That night I took dinner
with him alone—the evening you had the—er—headache
and went to bed. ’Member?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” sighed Dorothy, nodding.</p>

<p>“He just pumped me about you,” said Tavia.
“And I was just foolish enough to tell him all
about your money—how rich your folks were and
all that.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” and Dorothy flushed again.</p>

<p>“You don’t get it—not yet,” said Tavia, wagging
her head. “Afterwards I remembered how
funny he looked when I had told him that you
were a regular ‘sure-enough’ heiress, and I remembered
some things he said, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Dorothy, faintly.</p>

<p>“Why, I scared him away from you,” blurted
out Tavia, almost in tears when she thought of
what she called her “ivory-headedness.” “I know
that he was just as deeply smitten with you, dear,
as—as—well, as ever a man could be! But he’s
poor—and he’s game. I think that is why he went
off in such a hurry and without trying <em>very</em> hard
to see you again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tavia! Do you believe that is so?” and
the joy in Dorothy’s voice could not be mistaken.</p>

<p>“Well!” exclaimed Tavia, “isn’t that pretty
bad? You act as though you were pleased.”</p>

<p>Dorothy blushed again, but she was brave. She
gazed straight into Tavia’s eyes as she said:</p>

<p>“I am pleased, dear. I am pleased to learn that
possibly it was not his lack of interest in poor
little me that sent him away from New York so
hastily—at least, without making a more desperate
effort to see me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Doro!” cried Tavia, suddenly putting both
arms around her friend. “Do you actually mean
it?”</p>

<p>“Mean what?”</p>

<p>“That you l-l-<em>like</em> him so much?”</p>

<p>Dorothy laughed aloud, but nodded emphatically.
“I l-l-<em>like</em> him just as much as that,” she
mocked. “And if it’s only my father’s money in
the way——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>“And your own. You really will be rich when
you are twenty-one,” Tavia reminded her. “I
tell you, that young man was troubled a heap when
he learned from me that you were so well off. If
you had been a poor girl—if you had been <em>me</em>,
for instance—he would never have left New York
City without knowing his fate. I could see it in
his eyes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tavia!” gasped Dorothy, with clasped
hands and shining eyes.</p>

<p>“My dear,” said her friend, with serious mouth
but dancing orbs. “I never would have thought
it possible—of <em>you</em>. ‘Love like a lightning bolt’—just
like that. And the cautious Dorothy!” Then
she went on: “But, Dorothy, how will you ever
find him?”</p>

<p>“You have done your best, Tavia,” her friend
said, nodding. “I suppose I might have tried
Lance Petterby, too. But now I shall put Aunt
Winnie’s lawyers to work out there. If possible,
Mr. Knapp must be found before those real estate
sharks buy his land. But if the transaction is completed,
we shall have to reach him in some other
way.”</p>

<p>“Dorothy! You sound woefully strong-minded.
Do you mean to go right after the young man—just
as though it were leap year?” and Tavia giggled.</p>

<p>“I hope,” said Dorothy Dale, girl of to-day that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
she was, “I have too much good sense to lose the
chance of showing the man I love that he can
win me, because of any foolish or old-fashioned
ideas of conventionalities. If Garry Knapp thinks
as much of me as I do of him, his lack of an equal
fortune sha’n’t stand in the way, either.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Doro! it sounds awful—but bully!”
Tavia declared, her eyes round. “Do you mean
it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Dorothy, courageously.</p>

<p>“But suppose he is one of those stubborn beings
you read about—one of the men who will not
marry a girl with money unless he has a ‘working
capital’ himself?”</p>

<p>“That shall not stand in our way.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” gasped Tavia. “Not
that you would give up your money for him?”</p>

<p>“If I find I love him enough—yes,” said Dorothy,
softly.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE BUD UNFOLDS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In a certain way it ages a girl to be left motherless
as Dorothy Dale had been. She had been
obliged to “play mother” herself so early that
her maternal instincts were strongly and early developed.</p>

<p>Until the Dale family had come away from
Dalton to live with Aunt Winnie at The Cedars,
Dorothy had exercised her motherly oversight
in the little family. Indeed, Roger scarcely knew
any other mother than Dorothy, and Joe had almost
forgotten her who had passed away soon
after Roger was born.</p>

<p>As for the major, he had soon given all domestic
matters over into the small but capable hands
of “the little captain” while they were still struggling
in poverty. After coming to The Cedars,
Dorothy, of course, had been relieved of the close
oversight of domestic and family matters that had
previously been her portion. But its effect upon her
character was plain to all observing eyes. Nor had
her so early developed maternal characteristics
failed to affect the other members of the family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>Now that she was really grown up past the
schoolgirl age and of a serious and thoughtful
demeanor, even Aunt Winnie looked upon her as
being much older than Tavia—and years older
than the boys. That Ned and Nat were both several
years Dorothy’s senior made no difference.</p>

<p>“Boys are to a degree irresponsible—and always
are, no matter how old they become,” said
Aunt Winnie. “But <em>Dorothy</em>——”</p>

<p>Her emphasis was approved by the major.
“The little captain is some girl,” he said, chuckling.
“Beg pardon! woman grown, eh, Sister?”</p>

<p>Nor was his approval merely of Dorothy’s surface
qualities. He knew that his pretty daughter
was a much deeper thinker than most girls of her
age, and he had seldom interfered in any way
with Dorothy’s personal decisions on any subject.</p>

<p>“Let her find out for herself. She won’t go far
wrong,” had often been his remark at first when
his sister had worried over Dorothy in her school
days. And so the girl developed into something
that not all girls are—an original thinker.</p>

<p>Knowing her as the major did and trusting in
her good sense so fully, he was less startled, perhaps,
than he would otherwise have been when
Dorothy took him into her confidence regarding
Garry Knapp. Tavia had refrained from joking
about the Westerner from the first. Little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
had been said before the family about their adventures
in New York. Therefore, the major was
not prepared in the least for the introduction of
the subject.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would not have been introduced in
quite the way it was had it not grown out of another
matter. It came the day after Christmas—that
day in which everybody is tired and rather
depressed because of the over-exertion of celebrating
the feast of good Kris Kringle. Dorothy
was busy at the sewing basket beside her father’s
comfortable chair. She knew that Tavia was writing
letters and just at this moment Major Dale
dropped his paper to peer out of the window.</p>

<p>“There goes Nat—off for a tramp, I’ll be
bound. And he’s alone,” the major said.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Dorothy without looking up.</p>

<p>“And Ned and that Jennie girl are in the library,
and you’re here,” pursued the major, with
raised eyebrows. “Where is Tavia?”</p>

<p>She told him; but she refrained again from
looking up, and he finally bent forward in his chair
and thrust a forefinger under her chin, raising it
and making her look at him.</p>

<p>“Say! what is the matter with Tavia and Nat?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Are you sure there is anything the matter,
Major?” Dorothy responded.</p>

<p>“Can’t fool me. They’re at outs. And you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
Captain? Is that what makes you so grave, my
dear?”</p>

<p>“No, Daddy,” she said, putting down her work
and looking into his rugged face this time of her
own volition.</p>

<p>“Something personal, my dear?”</p>

<p>“Very personal, Daddy,” calling him by the intimate
name the children used. “I—I think I—I
am in love.”</p>

<p>He neither made a joke of it nor appeared astonished.
He just eyed her quietly and nodded.
The flush mounted into her face and she glowed
like a red rose. After all, it is not the easiest
thing in the world to turn the heart out for others
to look at, even the dearest of others.</p>

<p>“I think I am in love. And the young man is
poor—and—and I am afraid our money is going
to stand between him and me.”</p>

<p>“My dear Dorothy,” said the major, “are you
really in love with somebody, or in love with
love?”</p>

<p>“I know what you mean,” his daughter said,
with a tremulous little laugh and shaking her head.
“Seeing so many about us falling into the toils of
Dan Cupid, you think I perhaps imagine I have
fixed my affections upon some particular object.
Is that it, Major?”</p>

<p>He nodded, a quizzical little smile on his lips.</p>

<p>“No” she said. “It isn’t anywhere near as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
simple as that. I—I do love him I believe. He
is the only man I have ever really thought twice
about. He is the center of all my thoughts now,
and has been for a long time.”</p>

<p>“But—but who is he?” the major gasped.</p>

<p>“Garry Knapp.”</p>

<p>Her father repeated the name slowly and his
expression of countenance certainly displayed
amazement. “Did I ever see the young man?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Your aunt—one of your cousins’ friends?”</p>

<p>“Dear Daddy,” said Dorothy, frankly and smiling
a little. “I have done something not at all
as you would expect cautious little me to do. I
have picked a man—and, oh, he is a man, Daddy!—right
out of the great mob of folks. Nobody
introduced us. We just—well, <em>met</em>.”</p>

<p>“The young man has been spoken of by Tavia,
I believe,” said Major Dale, quite cheerfully. “I
remember now. Mr. Knapp. You met him at
the hotel in New York?”</p>

<p>“Before we got to the hotel. In the train I
noticed him—vaguely. On the platform where
we changed cars at that Manhattan Transfer
place, I saw him better. I—I never was so much
interested in a man before.”</p>

<p>Major Dale looked at her rather solemnly for
a moment. “Are you sure, my dear, it is anything
more than fancy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>

<p>“Quite sure.”</p>

<p>“And—and—<em>he</em>——”</p>

<p>The man’s voice actually trembled. Dorothy
looked at him again, dropped the sewing from her
lap and suddenly flung her arms about his neck.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear!” she murmured, her face hidden.
“I know he loves me, too. I am sure of
it! Let me tell you.”</p>

<p>Breathlessly, her voice quavering a little but
full of an element of happiness that fairly thrilled
her listener, she related all the incidents—even
the petty details—of her acquaintance with Garford
Knapp, of Desert City. So clear was her
picture of the young man that the major saw him
in his mind’s eye just as Garry appeared to Dorothy
Dale.</p>

<p>She went over every little thing that had happened
in New York in connection with the young
Westerner. She told of her own mean suspicions
and how they had risen from a feeling of pique
and jealousy that never in her life had she experienced
before.</p>

<p>“That was a rather small way for me to show
real feeling for a person. But it caught me unprepared,”
said Dorothy, with a full-throated laugh
although her eyes were full of tears. “I do not
believe I am naturally of a jealous disposition;
and I should never let such a feeling get the better
of me again. It has cost me too much.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>She went on and told the major of the incidents
that followed and how Garry Knapp had gone
away so hastily without her speaking to him again.</p>

<p>But the major rather lost the thread of her
story for a moment. He was staring closely at
her, shaking his shaggy head slowly.</p>

<p>“My dear! my dear!” he murmured, “you have
grown up. The bud has unfolded. Our demure
little Dorothy is—and with shocking abruptness—blown
into full womanhood. My dear!” and he
put his arms about her again more tightly.</p>

<span class="fs80">DOROTHY DECIDES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Joe and Roger Dale did not feel that they were
exactly neglected during these winter holidays. It
is true they found their cousins, the “big fellows,”
not so much fun as they were wont to be, and even
Dorothy failed them at times.</p>

<p>But because of these very facts the lads had
more freedom of action than ever before. They
were learning to think for themselves, especially
Joe. Nor was it always mischief they thought of,
though frequently managing to get into trouble—for
what live and healthy boys of their age do
not?</p>

<p>Many of their narrow escapes even Dorothy
knew nothing about. None of the family, for instance,
knew about Joe and the lame pigeon until
the North Birchland Fire Department was on
the grounds with all their apparatus.</p>

<p>This moving incident (Tavia declared it should
have been a movie incident) happened between
Christmas and the new year. Although there had
been a good fall of snow before Kris Kringle’s
day, it had all gone now and the roads were firmly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
frozen again, so the Fire Department got to The
Cedars in record time.</p>

<p>To begin with Joe and Roger were breeders of
pigeons, as Ned and Nat had been several years
before. On pleasant days in the winter they let
their flock into the big flying cage, and occasionally
allowed the carriers to take a flight in the
open.</p>

<p>On one of these occasions when the flock returned
there was a stray with them. Roger’s
sharp eyes spied this bird which alighted on the
ridgepole of the stable.</p>

<p>“Oh, lookut! lookut!” exclaimed the youngest
Dale. “What a pretty one, Joe!”</p>

<p>“We’ll coax it down. It’s a stray,” his brother
said eagerly, “and all strays are fair game.”</p>

<p>“But it’s lame, Joe,” Roger declared. “See!
it can scarcely hop. And it acts as if all tired
out.”</p>

<p>“It’s a carrier, all right,” Joe said. “I bet it’s
come a long way.”</p>

<p>The bird, however, would not be coaxed to the
ground or into the big cage. It really did appear
exhausted.</p>

<p>“I bet if I could get up there on the stable roof,
I could pick it right up in my hand,” cried Joe.
“I’m—I’m a-going—to try it!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” murmured Roger, both his eyes and
mouth very round.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>Joe was no “blowhard,” as the boys say. When
he said he’d do a thing he did his best to accomplish
it. He threw off his thick jacket that would
have hampered him, and kicked aside his overshoes
that made his feet clumsy, and started to
go aloft in the stable.</p>

<p>“You go outside and watch, Roger,” he commanded.
“There’s no skylight in this old barn
roof—only the cupola, and I can’t get out through
that.”</p>

<p>“How are you going to do it then?” gasped
Roger.</p>

<p>“You’ll see,” his brother said with assurance,
and began to climb the hay ladder into the top loft
of the building.</p>

<p>Roger ran out just in time to see Joe open the
small door up in the peak of the stable roof.
There were water-troughs all around the roof, for
the cattle were supplied with drinking water from
cisterns built under the ground.</p>

<p>A leader ran down each corner of the stable,
and one of these was within reach of Joe Dale’s
hands when he swung himself out upon the door
he had opened.</p>

<p>Nobody, except the boys, were about the stable,
and this end of the building could not be seen from
the house. Joe had once before performed a similar
trick. He had swung from the door to the
leader-pipe and swarmed down to the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>“Look out you don’t tumble, Joe,” advised the
eager Roger. But he had no idea that Joe would
do so. The elder brother was a hero in the sight
of the younger lad.</p>

<p>Joe’s skill and strength did not fail him now.
He caught the leader, then the water-trough itself,
and so scrambled upon the roof. But at his last
kick some fastening holding the leader-pipe gave
way and the top of it swung out from the corner
of the stable.</p>

<p>“Oh, cricky!” yelled Roger. “Lucky you got
up there, Joe. That pipe’s busted. How’ll you
get down?”</p>

<p>“Never mind that,” grunted Joe, somewhat
breathless, scrambling up the roof to the ridgepole.
“We’ll see about that later.”</p>

<p>The boy reached the ridge and straddled it.
There he got his breath and then hitched along
toward the cooing pigeon. It was not frightened
by him, but it certainly was lame and exhausted.
Joe picked it up in his hand and snuggled it into
the breast of his sweater.</p>

<p>“But how are you ever going to get down, Joe
Dale?” shrilled Roger, from the ground.</p>

<p>The question was a poser, as Joe very soon
found out. That particular leader had been the
only one on the stable that he could reach with
any measure of safety; and now it hung out a
couple of feet from the side of the building and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
Joe would not have dared trust his weight upon it,
even could he have reached it.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” again wailed the
smaller lad.</p>

<p>“Aw, cheese it, Roger! don’t be bawling,” advised
Joe from the roof. “Go and get a ladder.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t any long enough to reach up there—you
know that,” said Roger.</p>

<p>Neither he nor Joe observed the fact that, even
had there been a ladder, the smaller boy could
not have raised it into place so that Joe could
have descended upon it.</p>

<p>None of the men working on the place was at
hand. Ned and Nat were off on some errand in
their car. Secretly, Roger was panic stricken and
might have run for Dorothy, for she was still his
refuge in all troubles.</p>

<p>But Joe was older—and thought himself wiser.
“We’ve just got to find a ladder—<em>you’ve</em> got to
find it, Roger. I can’t sit up here a-straddle of
this old roof all day. It’s co-o-old!”</p>

<p>Roger started off blindly. He could not remember
whether any of the neighbors possessed long
ladders or not. But as he came down to the street
corner of the White property he saw a red box
affixed to a telegraph pole on the edge of the sidewalk.</p>

<p>“Oh, bully!” gasped Roger, and immediately
scrambled over the fence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>He knew what that red box was for. It had
been explained to him, and he had longed for a
good reason for experimenting with it. You broke
the little square of glass and pulled down the hook
inside—-</p>

<p>That is how Ned and Nat, whizzing homeward
in their car, came to join the procession of the Fire
Department racing out of town toward The
Cedars.</p>

<p>“Where’s the fire, Cal?” yelled Nat, seeing a
man he knew riding on the ladder truck.</p>

<p>“Right near your house, Mr. White. At any
rate, that was the number pulled—that box by the
corner of your mother’s place.”</p>

<p>“Did you hear that, Ned?” shouted his brother,
and Ned, who was at the wheel, “let her out,”
breaking every speed law of the country to flinders.</p>

<p>The Fire Chief in his red racing car was only a
few rods ahead of the Whites, therefore, when
Ned whirled the automobile into the driveway.
They saw a small boy, greatly excited, dancing up
and down on the gravel beside the chief’s car.</p>

<p>“Yep—he’s up on the stable roof, I tell you.
We’ve got to use your extension ladders to get him
down,” Roger was saying eagerly. “I didn’t mean
for all of the things to come—the engine, and
hose cart, and all. Just the ladders we wanted,”
and Roger seemed amazed that his pulling the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
hook of the fire-alarm box had not explained all
this at fire headquarters down town.</p>

<p>There was some excitement, as may well be
believed in and about The Cedars. The Fire
Chief was at first enraged; then he, as well as his
men, laughed. They got Joe, still clinging to the
stray pigeon, down from the roof, and then the
firemen drilled back to town, reporting a “false
alarm.”</p>

<p>Major Dale, however, sent in a check to the
Firemen’s Benefit Fund, and Joe and Roger were
sent to bed at noon and were obliged to remain
there until the next morning—a punishment that
was likely long to be engraved upon their minds.</p>

<p>The incident, however, had broken in upon a
very serious conference between Dorothy Dale
and her father. And nowadays their conferences
were very likely to be for the discussion of but
one subject:</p>

<p>Garry Knapp and his affairs.</p>

<p>Aunt Winnie, too, had been taken into Dorothy
Dale’s confidence. “I want you both,” the
girl said, bravely, “to meet Garry Knapp and decide
for yourselves if he is not all I say he is. And
to do that we must get him to come here.”</p>

<p>“How will you accomplish it, Dorothy?” asked
her aunt, still more than a little confused because
of this entirely new departure upon the part of
her heretofore demure niece.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span></p>

<p>Dorothy explained. Another—a third—letter
had come from Lance Petterby. He had identified
Garry Knapp as the Dimples Knapp he had
previously known upon the range. Knapp was
about to sell a rundown ranch north of Desert
City and adjoining the rough end of the great
Hardin Estate, that now belonged to Major Dale,
to some speculators in wheat lands. The speculators,
Lance said, were “sure enough sharks.”</p>

<p>“First of all have our lawyers out there make
Mr. Knapp a much better offer for his land—quick,
before Stiffbold and Lightly close with him,”
Dorothy suggested. “Oh! I’ve thought it all out.
Those land speculators will allow that option they
took on Garry’s ranch to lapse. What is a hundred
dollars to them? Then they will play a
waiting game until they make him come to new
terms—a much lower price even than they offered
him in New York. He must not sell his land to
them, and for a song.”</p>

<p>“And then?” asked the major, his eyes bright
with pride in his daughter’s forcefulness of character,
as well as with amusement.</p>

<p>“Have our lawyers bind the bargain with Mr.
Knapp and ask him to come East to close the
transaction with their principal. That’s <em>you</em>,
Major. Meanwhile, have the lawyers send an
expert to Mr. Knapp’s ranch to see if it is really
promising wheat land if properly developed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>“And then?” repeated her father.</p>

<p>“If it <em>is</em>,” said Dorothy, laughing blithely,
“when Garry shows up and you and Aunt Winnie
approve of him, as I know you both will, offer
to advance the money necessary to develop the
wheat ranch instead of buying the land.</p>

<p>“That,” Dorothy Dale said earnestly, “will
give him the start in business life he needs. I
know he has it in him to make good. He can expect
no fortune from his uncle in Alaska, who is
angry with him; he will <em>never</em> hear to using any
of my money to help bring success; but in this way
he will have his chance. I believe he will be independent
in a few years.”</p>

<p>“And, meanwhile, what of you?” cried her
aunt.</p>

<p>“I shall be waiting for him,” replied Dorothy
with a smile that Tavia, had she seen it, would
have pronounced “seraphic.”</p>

<p>“Major! did you ever hear of such talk from
a girl?” gasped Aunt Winnie.</p>

<p>“No,” said her brother, with immense satisfaction,
and thumping approval on the floor with
his cane. “Because there never was just such a
girl since the world began as my little captain.</p>

<p>“I want to see this wonderful Garry Knapp—don’t
you, Sister? I’m sure he must be a perfectly
wonderful young man to so stir our Dorothy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>“No,” Dorothy said slowly shaking her head.
“I know he is only wonderful in my eyes. But
I am quite sure you and Aunt Winnie will commend
my choice when you have met him—if we
can only get him here!”</p>

<span class="fs80">NAT JUMPS AT A CONCLUSION</span></h2>
</div>

<p>All this time Tavia and Nat were having anything
but a happy life. Nat would not have admitted
it for the world, but he wished he could
leave home and never appear at The Cedars again
until Tavia had gone.</p>

<p>On her part, Tavia would have returned to Dalton
before the new year had Dorothy allowed her
to have her own way. Dorothy would not hear
of such a thing.</p>

<p>To make the situation worse for the pair of
young people so tragically enduring their first
vital misunderstanding, Ned and Jennie Hapgood
were sailing upon a sea of blissful and unruffled
happiness. Nat and Tavia could not help noting
this fact. The feeling of the exalted couple for
each other was so evident that even the Dale boys
discussed it—and naturally with deep disgust.</p>

<p>“Gee!” breathed Joe, scandalized. “Old Ned
is so mushy over Jennie Hapgood that he goes
around in a trance. He could tread on his own
corns and not know it, his head is so far up in
the clouds. Gee!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>“<em>I</em> wouldn’t ever get so silly over a girl—not
even our Dorothy,” Roger declared. “Would
you, Joe?”</p>

<p>“Not in a hundred years,” was his brother’s
earnest response.</p>

<p>The major admitted with a chuckle that Ned
certainly was hard hit. The time set for Jennie
Hapgood to return to Sunnyside Farm came and
passed, and still many reasons were found for the
prolongation of her visit. Ned went off to New
York one day by himself and brought home at
night something that made a prominent bulge in
his lower right-hand vest pocket.</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>oh</em>, OH! Dorothy!” ejaculated Tavia, for
the moment coming out of her own doldrums.
“Do you know what it is? A Tiffany box! Nothing
less!”</p>

<p>“Dear old Ned,” said her chum, with a smile.</p>

<p>Ned and Jennie disappeared together right
after dinner. Then, an hour later, they appeared
in the drawing-room where the family was assembled
and Ned led Jennie forward by her left
hand—the fingers prominently extended.</p>

<p>“White gold—platinum!” murmured Tavia,
standing enthralled as she beheld the beautifully
set stone.</p>

<p>“Set old Ned back five hundred bucks if it did
a cent,” growled Nat, under his breath and keeping
in the background.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, Jennie!” cried Dorothy, jumping up.</p>

<p>But Aunt Winnie seemed to be nearest. She
reached the happy couple before anybody else.</p>

<p>“Ned needn’t tell me,” she said, with a little
laugh and a little sob and putting both arms about
Jennie. “Welcome, my daughter! Very welcome
to the White family. I have for years tried to
divide Dorothy with the major; now I am to have
at least <em>one</em> daughter of my very own.”</p>

<p>Did she flash a glance at Tavia standing in the
background? Tavia thought so. The proud and
headstrong girl was shot to the quick with the
arrow of the thought that Mrs. White had been
told by Nat of the difference between himself and
Tavia and that the lady would never come to
Tavia and ask that question on behalf of her
younger son that the girl so desired her to ask.</p>

<p>Never before had Tavia realized so keenly the
great chasm between herself and Jennie Hapgood.
Mrs. White welcomed Jennie so warmly, and was
so glad, because Jennie was of the same level in
society as the Whites. Both in blood and wealth
Jennie was Ned’s equal.</p>

<p>Tavia knew very well that by explaining to Nat
about Lance Petterby’s letters she could easily
bring that young man to his knees. In her heart,
in the very fiber of the girl’s being, indeed, had
grown the desire to have Dorothy Dale’s Aunt
Winnie tell her that she, too, would be welcome in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
the White family. Now Tavia doubted if Aunt
Winnie would ever do that.</p>

<p>Jennie was to go home to Sunnyside Farm the
next day. This final decision had probably
spurred Ned to action. Because of certain business
matters in town which occupied both Ned
and Nat at train time and the fact that Dorothy
was busy with some domestic duty, it was Tavia
who drove the <em>Fire Bird</em>, the Whites’ old car, to
the station with Jennie Hapgood.</p>

<p>A train from the West had come in a few minutes
before the westbound one which Jennie was
to take was due. Tavia, sitting in the car while
Jennie ran to get her checks, saw a tall man carrying
two heavy suitcases and wearing a broad-brimmed
hat walking down the platform.</p>

<p>“Why! if that doesn’t look——Surely it can’t
be—I—I believe I’ve got ’em again!” murmured
Tavia Travers.</p>

<p>Then suddenly she shot out from behind the
wheel, leaped to the platform, and ran straight for
the tall figure.</p>

<p>“Garry Knapp!” she exploded.</p>

<p>“Why—why—Miss Travers!” responded the
big young man, smiling suddenly and that “cute”
little dimple just showing in his bronzed cheek.
“You don’t mean to say you live in this man’s
town?”</p>

<p>He looked about the station in a puzzled way,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
and, having dropped his bags to shake hands with
her, rubbed the side of his head as though to
awaken his understanding.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand your being here, Miss
Travers,” he murmured.</p>

<p>“Why, <em>I’m</em> visiting here,” she said, blithely.
“But <em>you</em>——?”</p>

<p>“I—I’m here on business. Or I think I am,”
he said soberly. “How’s your—Miss Dale!
<em>She</em> doesn’t live here, does she?”</p>

<p>“Of course. Didn’t you know?” demanded
Tavia, eyeing him curiously.</p>

<p>“No. Who—what’s this Major Dale to her,
Miss Travers?” asked the young man and his
heavy brows met for an instant over his nose.</p>

<p>“Her father, of course, Mr. Knapp. Didn’t
you know Dorothy’s father was the only Major
Dale there <em>is</em>, and the nicest man there ever <em>was</em>?”</p>

<p>“How should I know?” demanded Garry
Knapp, contemplating Tavia with continued seriousness.
“What is he—a real estate man?”</p>

<p>“Why! didn’t you know?” Tavia asked, thinking
quickly. “Didn’t I tell you that time that he
was a close friend of Colonel Hardin, who owned
that estate you told me joined your ranch there
by Desert City?”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh,” grunted the young man. “Seems to
me you <em>did</em> tell me something about that. But I—I
must have had my mind on something else.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>“On <em>somebody</em> else, you mean,” said Tavia,
dimpling suddenly. “Well! Colonel Hardin left
his place to Major Dale.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s why, then. He wants to buy my
holdings because his land joins mine,” said Garry
Knapp, reflectively.</p>

<p>Tavia had her suspicions of the truth well
aroused; but all she replied was:</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder, Mr. Knapp.”</p>

<p>“I got a good offer—leastways, better than
those sharks, Stiffbold and Lightly, would make
me after they’d seen the ranch—from some lawyers
out there. They planked down a thousand
for an option, and told me to come East and close
the deal with this Major Dale. And it never
entered into this stupid head of mine that he was
related to—to Miss Dale.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that funny?” giggled Tavia. Then, as
Jennie appeared from the baggage room and the
westbound train whistled for the station, she
added: “Just wait for me until I see a friend off
on this train, Mr. Knapp, and I’ll drive you out.”</p>

<p>“Drive me out where?” asked Garry Knapp.</p>

<p>“To see—er—<em>Major</em> Dale,” she returned, and
ran away.</p>

<p>When the train had gone she found the Westerner
standing between his two heavy bags about
where she had left him.</p>

<p>“Those old suitcases look so natural,” she said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
laughing at his serious face. “Throw them into
the tonneau and sit beside me in front. I’ll show
you some driving.”</p>

<p>“But look here! I can’t do this,” he objected.</p>

<p>“You cannot do what?” demanded Tavia.</p>

<p>“Are <em>you</em> staying with Miss Dale?”</p>

<p>“Of course I am staying with Doro. I don’t
know but I am more at home at The Cedars than
I am at the Travers domicile in Dalton.”</p>

<p>“But wait!” he begged. “There must be a
hotel here?”</p>

<p>“In North Birchland? Of course.”</p>

<p>“You’d better take me there, Miss Travers, if
you’ll be so kind. I want to secure a room.”</p>

<p>“Nothing doing! You’ve got to come out to
The Cedars with me,” Tavia declared. “Why,
Do—I mean, of course, Major Dale would never
forgive me if I failed to bring you, baggage and
all. His friends do not stop at the North Birchland
House I’d have you know.”</p>

<p>“But, honestly, Miss Travers, I don’t like it.
I don’t understand it. And Major Dale isn’t my
friend.”</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>isn’t</em> he? You just wait and see!” cried
Tavia. “I didn’t know about your coming East.
Of course, if it is business——”</p>

<p>“That is it, exactly,” the young man said, nervously.
“I—I couldn’t impose upon these people,
you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>

<p>“Say! you want to sell your land, don’t you?”
demanded Tavia.</p>

<p>“Ye—es,” admitted Garry Knapp, slowly.</p>

<p>“Well, if a man came out your way to settle
a business matter, you wouldn’t let him go to a
hotel, would you? You’d be angry,” said Tavia,
sensibly, “if he insisted upon doing such a thing.
Major Dale could not have been informed when
you would arrive, or he would have had somebody
here at the station to meet you.”</p>

<p>“No. I didn’t tell the lawyers when I’d start,”
said Garry.</p>

<p>“Don’t make a bad matter worse then,” laughed
Tavia, her eyes twinkling as she climbed in and
sat back of the wheel. “Hurry up. If you want
to sell your land you’d better waste no more time
getting out to The Cedars.”</p>

<p>The Westerner got into the car in evident doubt.
He suspected that he had been called East for
something besides closing a real estate transaction.
Tavia suspected so, too; and she was vastly
amused.</p>

<p>She drove slowly, for Garry began asking her
for full particulars about Dorothy and the family.
Tavia actually did not know anything about
the proposed purchase of the Knapp ranch by her
chum’s father. Dorothy had said not a word to
her about Garry since their final talk some weeks
before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>At a place in the woods where there was not a
house in sight, Tavia even stopped the car the
better to give her full attention to Mr. Garry
Knapp, and to talk him out of certain objections
that seemed to trouble his mind.</p>

<p>It was just here that Nat White, on a sputtering
motorcycle he sometimes rode, passed the couple
in the automobile. He saw Tavia talking earnestly
to a fine-looking, broad-shouldered young
man wearing a hat of Western style. She had an
eager hand upon his shoulder and the stranger
was evidently much interested in what the girl
said.</p>

<p>Nat did not even slow down. It is doubtful if
Tavia noticed him at all. Nat went straight home,
changed his clothes, flung a few things into a traveling
bag, and announced to his mother that he
was off for Boston to pay some long-promised visits
to friends there and in Cambridge.</p>

<p>Nat, with his usual impulsiveness, had jumped
at a conclusion which, like most snap judgments,
was quite incorrect. He rode to the railroad
station by another way and so did not meet Tavia
and Garry Knapp as they approached The
Cedars.</p>

</div>

<p>Dorothy spied the Fire Bird just as it turned
in at the entrance gate. And she identified the
person sitting beside her chum, too. Therefore,
she had a few minutes in which to prepare for her
meeting with Garry Knapp.</p>

<p>She was on the porch when the car stopped, and
her welcome to the young Westerner possessed
just the degree of cordiality that it should.
Neither by word nor look did she betray the fact
that her heart’s action was accelerated, or that she
felt a thrill of joy to think that the first of her
moves in this intricate game had been successful.</p>

<p>“Of course, it would be Tavia’s good fortune
to pick you up at the station,” she said, while
Garry held her hand just a moment longer than
was really necessary for politeness’ sake. “Had
you telegraphed us——”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t a thought that I was going to run up
against Miss Travers or you, Miss Dale,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, then, this is a business visit?” and she
laughed. “Entirely? You only wish to see Major
Dale?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>“Well—now—that’s unfair,” he said, his eyes
twinkling. “But I told Miss Travers she might
drive me to the hotel.”</p>

<p>“Oh, this will be your hotel while you remain, of
course. Father would not hear of anything else
I am sure.”</p>

<p>“I can thank you, then, Miss Dale,” he said
quietly and with a sudden serious mien, “for the
chance to sell my ranch at a better price than those
sharks were ready to give?”</p>

<p>“No. You may thank Major Dale’s bump of
acquisitiveness,” she said, laughing at him over
her shoulder as she led the way into the house.
“Having so much land already out there, like
other great property owners, he is always looking
for more.”</p>

<p>If Garry Knapp was not assured that she was
entirely frank upon this matter, he knew that his
welcome was as warm as though he were really
an old friend. He met Mrs. White almost at
once, and Dorothy was delighted by her marked
approval of him.</p>

<p>Garry Knapp got to the major by slow degrees.
Tavia marveled as she watched Dorothy Dale’s
calm and assured methods. This was the demure,
cautious girl whom she had always looked upon
as being quite helpless when it came to managing
“affairs” with members of the opposite sex. Tavia
imagined she was quite able to manage any man—“put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
him in his place,” she termed it—much better
than Dorothy Dale. But now!</p>

<p>Dorothy quietly sent Joe and Roger out for
Mr. Knapp’s bags and told them to take the bags
up to an indicated room. She made no fuss about
it, but took it for granted that Garry Knapp had
come for a visit, not for a call.</p>

<p>The young man from the West had to sit down
and talk with Aunt Winnie. That lady proceeded
in her good-humored and tactful way to draw him
out. Aunt Winnie learned more about Garry
Knapp in those few minutes than even Tavia had
learned when she took dinner with the young man.
And all the time the watchful Dorothy saw Garry
Knapp growing in her aunt’s estimation.</p>

<p>Ned came in. He had been fussing and fuming
because business had kept him from personally
seeing Jennie Hapgood aboard her train. He
welcomed this big fellow from the West, perhaps,
because he helped take Ned’s mind off his
own affairs.</p>

<p>“Come on up and dress for dinner,” Ned suggested,
having gained Garry Knapp’s sole attention.
“It’s pretty near time for the big eats, and
mother is a stickler for the best bib and tucker at
the evening meal.”</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” gasped Garry Knapp in a panic.
“You don’t mean dinner dress? I haven’t had on
a swallowtail since I was in college.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>“Tuxedo will do,” Ned said lightly. “If you
didn’t bring ’em I’ll lend you. I’m about as broad
as you, my boy.”</p>

<p>Garry Knapp was three or four years older than
Ned, and that “my boy” sounded rather funny.
However, the Westerner did not smile. He accepted
the loan of the dinner coat and the vest
without comment, but he looked very serious while
he was dressing.</p>

<p>They went down together to meet the girls in
the drawing-room. Dorothy Dale and Tavia had
dressed especially for the occasion. Tavia
flaunted her fine feathers frankly; but demure
Dorothy’s eyes shone more gloriously than her
frock. Ned said:</p>

<p>“You look scrumptious, Coz. And, of course,
Tavia, you are a vision of delight. Where’s
Nat?”</p>

<p>“Nat?” questioned Tavia, her countenance falling.
“Is—isn’t he upstairs?”</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you know?” Dorothy cried. “He’s
gone to Boston. Left just before you came back
from the station, Tavia.”</p>

<p>“Well, of all things!” Ned said. “I’d have
gone with him if I’d really believed he meant it.
Old grouch! He’s been talking of lighting out
for a week. But I am glad,” he added cordially,
looking at Garry Knapp, “that I did not go. Then
I, too, might have missed meeting Mr. Knapp.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>Now, what was it kept Major Dale away from
the dinner table that evening? His excuse was
that a twinge or two of rheumatism kept him from
appearing with the family when dinner was called.
And yet Dorothy did not appear worried by her
father’s absence as she ordinarily would have
been. Tavia was secretly delighted by this added
manifestation of Dorothy’s finesse. Garry Knapp
could not find any excuse for withdrawing from
the house until he had interviewed the major.</p>

<p>As was usual at The Cedars, the evening meal
was a lively and enjoyable occasion. Tavia successfully
hid her chagrin at Nat’s absence; but
Joe and Roger were this evening the life of the
company.</p>

<p>“The river’s frozen,” sang Roger, “and we’re
going skating on it, Joe and I. Did you ever go
skating, Mr. Knapp?” for Roger believed it only
common politeness to bring the visitor into the
conversation.</p>

<p>“Sure enough,” laughed Garry Knapp. “I
used to be some skater, too.”</p>

<p>“You’d better come,” said Roger. “It’s going
to be moonlight—Popeye Jordan says so, and he
knows, for his father lights the street lamps and
this is one of the nights he doesn’t have to work.”</p>

<p>“I hope Popeye hasn’t made a mistake—or
Mr. Jordan, either—in reading the almanac,”
Dorothy said, when the laugh had subsided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p>“You’d better come, too, Dorothy,” said Joe.
“The river’s as smooth as glass.”</p>

<p>“Let’s all go,” proposed Tavia, glad to be in
anything active that would occupy her mind and
perhaps would push out certain unpleasant
thoughts that lodged there.</p>

<p>“Mr. Knapp has no skates,” said Dorothy,
softly.</p>

<p>“Don’t let that stop you,” the Westerner put
in, smiling. “I can go and look on.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess we can give you a look <em>in</em>,” said
Ned. “There’s Nat’s skates. I think he didn’t
take ’em with him.”</p>

<p>“Will they fit Mr. Knapp?” asked Tavia.</p>

<p>“Dead sure that nobody’s got a bigger foot
than old Nat,” said his brother wickedly. “If
Mr. Knapp can get into my coat, he’ll find no
trouble in getting into Nat’s shoes.”</p>

<p>Ned rather prided himself on his own small and
slim foot and often took a fling at the size of his
brother’s shoes. But now, Nat not being present,
he hoped to “get a rise” out of Tavia. The girl,
however, bit her lip and said nothing. She was
not even defending Nat these days.</p>

<p>It was concluded that all should go—that is, all
the young people then present. Nat and Jennie’s
absence made what Ned called “a big hole” in the
company.</p>

<p>“You be good to me, Dot,” he said to his cousin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
as they waited in the side hall for Tavia to come
down. “I’m going to miss Jennie awfully. I want
to skate with you and tell you all about it.”</p>

<p>“All about what?” demanded his cousin, laughing.</p>

<p>“Why, all about how we came to—to—to find
out we cared for each other,” Ned whispered,
blunderingly enough but very earnest. “You
know, Dot, it’s just wonderful——”</p>

<p>“You go on, dear,” said Dorothy, poking a
gloved forefinger at him. “If you two sillies didn’t
know you were in love with each other till you
brought home the ring the other night, why everybody
else in the neighborhood was aware of the
fact æons and æons ago!”</p>

<p>“Huh?” grunted Ned, his eyes blinking in surprise.</p>

<p>“It was the most transparent thing in the world.
Everybody around here saw how the wind blew.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean it!” said the really astonished
Ned. “Well! and I didn’t know it myself till I
began to think how bad a time I was going to
have without Jennie. I wish old Nat would play
up to Tavia.”</p>

<p>Dorothy looked at him scornfully. “Well! of
all the stupid people who ever lived, most men are
<em>it</em>,” she thought. But what she said aloud was:</p>

<p>“I want to skate with Mr. Knapp, Nedward.
You know he is our guest. You take Tavia.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>“Pshaw!” muttered her cousin as the girl in
question appeared and Garry Knapp and the boys
came in from the porch where the Westerner had
been trying on Nat’s skating boots. “I can’t talk
to the flyaway as I can to you. But I don’t blame
you for wanting to skate with Knapp. He seems
like a mighty fine fellow.”</p>

<p>Dorothy was getting the family’s opinion, one
by one, of the man Tavia wickedly whispered
Dorothy had “set her cap” for. The younger boys
were plainly delighted with Garry Knapp. When
the party got to the river Joe and Roger would
scarcely let the guest and Dorothy get away by
themselves.</p>

<p>Garry Knapp skated somewhat awkwardly at
first, for he had not been on the ice for several
years. But he was very sure footed and it was evident
utterly unafraid.</p>

<p>He soon “got the hang of it,” as he said, and
was then ready to skate away with Dorothy. The
Dale boys tried to keep up; but with one of his
smiles into the girl’s face, Knapp suddenly all but
picked her up and carried her off at a great pace
over the shining, black ice.</p>

<p>“Oh! you take my breath!” she cried half
aloud, yet clinging with delight to his arm.</p>

<p>“We’ll dodge the little scamps and then get
down to <em>talk</em>,” he said. “I want to know all about
it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>

<p>“All about what?” she returned, looking at him
with shy eyes and a fluttering at her heart that she
was glad he could not know about.</p>

<p>“About this game of getting me East again.
I can see your fine Italian hand in this, Miss Dale.
Does your father really need my land?”</p>

<p>He said it bluntly, and although he smiled,
Dorothy realized there was something quite serious
behind his questioning.</p>

<p>“Well, you see, after you had left the hotel in
New York, Tavia and I overheard those two
awful men you agreed to sell to talking about the
bargain,” she said rather stumblingly, but with
earnestness.</p>

<p>“You did!” he exclaimed. “The sharks!”</p>

<p>“That is exactly what they were. They said
after Stiffbold got out West he would try to beat
you down in your price, although at the terms
agreed upon he knew he was getting a bargain.”</p>

<p>“Oh-ho!” murmured Garry Knapp. “That’s
the way of it, eh? They had me scared all right.
I gave them an option for thirty days for a hundred
dollars and they let the option run out. I
was about to accept a lower price when your father’s
lawyers came around.”</p>

<p>“You see, Tavia and I were both interested,”
Dorothy explained. “And Tavia wrote to a
friend of ours, Lance Petterby——”</p>

<br>

<p>“Ah! that’s why old Lance came riding over
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>to Bob Douglass’ place, was it?” murmured Garry.</p>

<p>“Then,” said Dorothy, bravely, “I mentioned
the matter to father, and he is always willing to
buy property adjoining the Hardin place. Thinks
it is a good investment. He and Aunt Winnie,
too, have a high opinion of that section of the
country. They believe it is <em>the</em> coming wheat-growing
land of the States.”</p>

<p>Garry’s mind seemed not to be absorbed by
this phase of the subject. He said abruptly:</p>

<p>“Your folks are mighty rich, Miss Dale, aren’t
they?”</p>

<p>Dorothy started at this blunt and unusual question,
but, after a moment’s hesitation, decided to
answer as frankly as the question had been put.</p>

<p>“Oh! Aunt Winnie married a wealthy man—yes,”
she said. “Professor Winthrop White. But
we were very poor, indeed, until a few years ago
when a distant relative left the major some property.
Then, of course, this Hardin estate is a
big thing.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Garry, shortly. “And you are
going to be wealthy in your own right when you
are of age. So your little friend told me.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sighed Dorothy. “Tavia <em>will</em> talk. The
same relative who left father his first legacy, tied
up some thousands for poor little me.”</p>

<p>Immediately Garry Knapp talked of other
things. The night was fine and the moon, a silver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
paring, hung low above the hills. The stars were
so bright that they were reflected in the black ice
under the skaters’ ringing steel.</p>

<p>Garry and Dorothy had shot away from the
others and were now well down the river toward
the milldam. So perfectly had the ice frozen that
when they turned the blades of the skates left
long, soaplike shavings behind them.</p>

<p>With clasped hands, they took the stroke together
perfectly. Never had Dorothy skated with
a partner that suited her so well. Nor had she
ever sped more swiftly over the ice.</p>

<p>Suddenly, she felt Garry’s muscles stiffen and
saw his head jerk up as he stared ahead.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she murmured, her own eyes so
misty that she could not see clearly. Then in a
moment she uttered a frightened “Oh!”</p>

<p>They had crossed the river, and now, on coming
back, there unexpectedly appeared a long, open
space before them. The water was so still that
at a distance the treacherous spot looked just like
the surrounding ice.</p>

<p>The discovery was made too late for them to
stop. Indeed, Garry Knapp increased his speed,
picked her up in his arms and it seemed to Dorothy
that they fairly flew over the open water,
landing with a resonant ring of steel upon the
safe ice beyond.</p>

<p>For the moment that she was held tightly in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
young man’s arms, she clung to him with something
besides fear.</p>

<p>“Oh, Garry!” she gasped when he set her down
again.</p>

<p>“Some jump, eh?” returned the young man
coolly.</p>

<p>They skated on again without another word.</p>

</div>

<p>The major was ready to see Garry Knapp at
nine o’clock the next morning. He was suffering
one of his engagements with the enemy rheumatism,
and there really was a strong reason for his
having put off this interview until the shy Westerner
had become somewhat settled at The Cedars
as a guest.</p>

<p>Dorothy took Garry up to the major’s room
after breakfast, and they found him well-wrapped
in a rug, sitting in his sun parlor which overlooked
the lawns of The Cedars.</p>

<p>The young man from the West could not help
being impressed by the fact that he was the guest
of a family that was well supplied with this world’s
goods—one that was used to luxury as well as
comfort. Is it strange that the most impressive
point to him was the fact that he had no right to
even <em>think</em> of trying to win Dorothy Dale?</p>

<p>When he had awakened that morning and
looked over the luxurious furnishings of his chamber
and the bathroom and dressing room connected
with it, he had told himself:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p>“Garford Knapp, you are in wrong! This is
no place for a cowpuncher from the Western
plains. What little tad of money you can sell
your ranch for won’t put you in any such class as
these folk belong to.</p>

<p>“And as for thinking of that girl—Great Scot!
I’d make a fine figure asking any girl used to such
luxury as this to come out and share a shack in
Desert City or thereabout, while I punched cattle,
or went to keeping store, or tried to match my
wits in real estate with the sharks that exploit land
out there.</p>

<p>“Forget it, Garford!” he advised himself,
grimly. “If you can make an honest deal with
this old major, make it and then clear out. This
is no place for you.”</p>

<p>He had, therefore, braced himself for the interview.
The major, eyeing him keenly as he
walked down the long room beside Dorothy, made
his own judgment—as he always did—instantly.
When Dorothy had gone he said frankly to the
young man:</p>

<p>“Mr. Knapp, I’m glad to see you. I have heard
so much about you that I feel you and I are already
friends.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” said Garry, quietly, eyeing
the major with as much interest as the latter eyed
him.</p>

<p>“When my daughter was talking one day about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
you and the land you had in the market adjoining
the Hardin tract it struck me that perhaps it
would be a good thing to buy,” went on the major,
briskly. “So I set our lawyers on your trail.”</p>

<p>“So Miss Dorothy tells me, sir,” the young man
said.</p>

<p>“Now, they know all about the offer made you
by those sharpers, Stiffbold &amp; Lightly. They advised
me to risk a thousand dollar option on your
ranch and I telegraphed them to make you the
offer.”</p>

<p>“And you may believe I was struck all of a
heap, sir,” said the young man, still eyeing the
major closely. “I’ll tell you something: You’ve
got me guessing.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?” asked the amused Major Dale.</p>

<p>“Why, people don’t come around and hand me
a thousand dollars every day—and just on a gamble.”</p>

<p>“Sure I am gambling?” responded the major.</p>

<p>“I’m not sure of anything,” admitted Garry
Knapp. “But it looks like that. I accepted the
certified check—I have it with me. I don’t know
but I’d better hand it back to you, Major, for I
think you have been misinformed about the real
value of the ranch. The price per acre your lawyers
offer is away above the market.”</p>

<p>“Hey!” exclaimed Major Dale. “You call
yourself a business man?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>“Not much of one, I suppose,” said Garry.
“I’ll sell you my ranch quick enough at a fair
price. But this looks as if you were doing me a
favor. I think you have been influenced.”</p>

<p>“Eh?” stammered the astounded old gentleman.</p>

<p>“By your daughter,” said Garry, quietly. “I’m
conceited enough to think it is because of Miss
Dale that you make me the offer you do.”</p>

<p>“Any crime in that?” demanded the major.</p>

<p>“No crime exactly,” rejoined Garry with one of
his rare smiles, “unless I take advantage of it.
But I’m not the sort of fellow, Major Dale, who
can willingly accept more than I can give value
for. Your offer for my ranch is beyond reason.”</p>

<p>“Would you have thought so if another
man—somebody instead of my daughter’s
father——” and his eyes twinkled as he said it,
“had made you the offer?”</p>

<p>Garry Knapp was silent and showed confusion.
The major went on with some grimness of expression:</p>

<p>“But if your conscience troubles you and you
wish to call the deal off, now is your chance to return
the check.”</p>

<p>Instantly Garry pulled his wallet from his
pocket and produced the folded green slip, good
for a thousand dollars at the Desert City Trust
Company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p>“There you are, sir,” he said quietly, and laid
the paper upon the arm of the major’s chair.</p>

<p>The old gentleman picked it up, identified it, and
slowly tore the check into strips, eyeing the young
man meanwhile.</p>

<p>“Then,” he said, calmly, “<em>that</em> phase of the matter
is closed. But you still wish to sell your
ranch?”</p>

<p>“I do, Major Dale. But I can’t accept what
anybody out there would tell you was a price out
of all reason.”</p>

<p>“Except my lawyers,” suggested the major.</p>

<p>“Well——”</p>

<p>“Young man, you have done a very foolish
thing,” said Major Dale. “A ridiculous thing,
perhaps. Unless you are shrewder than you
seem. My lawyers have had your land thoroughly
cruised. You have the best wheat land, in embryo,
anywhere in the Desert City region.”</p>

<p>Garry started and stared at him for a minute
without speaking. Then he sighed and shrugged
his shoulders.</p>

<p>“That may be, sir. Perhaps you <em>do</em> know more
about the intrinsic value of my ranch than I do
myself. But I know it would cost a mint of money
to develop that old rundown place into wheat
soil.”</p>

<p>“Humph! and if you had this—er—<em>mint</em> of
money, what would you do?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>“Do? I’d develop it myself!” cried the young
man, startled into enthusiastic speech. “I know
there is a fortune there. <em>You</em> are making big
profits on the Hardin place already, I understand.
Cattle have gone out; but wheat has come to stay.
Oh, I know all about that! But what’s the use?”</p>

<p>“Have you tried to raise money for the development
of your land?” asked the major quietly.</p>

<p>“I’ve talked to some bankers, yes. Nothing
doing. The machinery and fertilizer cost at the
first would be prohibitive. A couple of crop failures
would wipe out everything, and the banks
don’t want land on their hands. As for the money-lenders—well,
Major Dale, you can imagine what
sort of hold <em>they</em> demand when they deal with a
person in my situation.”</p>

<p>“And you would rather have what seems to you
a fair price for your land and get it off your
hands?”</p>

<p>“I’ll accept a fair price—yes. But I can’t accept
any favors,” said the young man, his face
gloomy enough but as stubborn as ever.</p>

<p>“I see,” said the major. “Then what will you
do with the money you get?”</p>

<p>“Try to get into some business that will make
me more,” and Garry looked up again with a
sudden smile.</p>

<p>“Raising wheat does not attract you, then?”</p>

<p>“It’s the biggest prospect in that section. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
know it has cattle raising and even mining backed
clear across the board. But it’s no game for a
little man with little capital.”</p>

<p>“Then why not get into it?” asked Major Dale,
still speaking quietly. “You seem enthusiastic.
Enthusiasm and youth—why, my boy, they will
carry a fellow far!”</p>

<p>Garry looked at him in a rather puzzled way.
“But don’t I tell you, Major Dale, that the banks
will not let me have money?”</p>

<p>“I’ll let you have the money—and at a fair interest,”
said Major Dale.</p>

<p>Garry smiled slowly and put out his hand. The
major quickly took it and his countenance began
to brighten. But what Garry said caused the old
gentleman’s expression to become suddenly doleful:</p>

<p>“I can’t accept your offer, sir. I know that it
is a favor—a favor that is suggested by Miss
Dorothy. If it were not for her, you would never
have thought of sending for me or making either
of these more than kind propositions you have
made.</p>

<p>“I shall have to say no—and thank you.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI<br>
<span class="fs80">SERIOUS THOUGHTS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The young people at The Cedars had taken
Garry Knapp right into the heart of their social
life. He knew he was welcome and the hospitality
shown him was a most delightful experience for
the young Westerner.</p>

<p>But “business was business.” He could not see
wherein he had any right to accept a favor from
Major Dale because Dorothy wished her father
to aid him. That was not Garry’s idea of a manly
part—to use the father of the girl you love as a
staff in getting on in the world.</p>

<p>There was no conceit in Garry’s belief that he
had tacit permission, was it right to accept it, to
try to win Dorothy Dale’s heart and hand. He
was just as well assured in his soul that Dorothy
had been attracted to him as he was that she had
gained his affection. “Love like a lightning bolt,”
Tavia had called Dorothy’s interest in Garry
Knapp. It was literally true in the young man’s
case. He had fallen in love with Dorothy Dale
almost at first sight.</p>

<p>Every time he saw her during that all too brief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
occasion in New York his feeling for the girl had
grown. By leaps and bounds it increased until,
just as Tavia had once said, if Dorothy had been
in Tavia’s financial situation Garry Knapp would
never have left New York without first learning
whether or not there was any possible chance of
his winning the girl he knew he loved.</p>

<p>Now it was revealed to him that he had that
chance—and bitterly did he regret the knowledge.
For he gained it at the cost of his peace of mind.</p>

<p>It is one thing to long for the object forbidden
us; it is quite another thing to know that we may
claim that longed-for object if honor did not interfere.
To Garry Knapp’s mind he could not
meet what was Dorothy Dale’s perfectly proper
advances, and keep his own self-respect.</p>

<p>Were he more sanguine, or a more imaginative
young man, he might have done so. But Garry
Knapp’s head was filled with hard, practical common
sense. Young men and more often young
girls allow themselves to become engaged with
little thought for the future. Garry was not that
kind. Suppose Dorothy Dale did accept his attentions
and was willing to wait for him until he
could win out in some line of industrial endeavor
that would afford the competence that he believed
he should possess before marrying a girl used to
the luxuries Dorothy was used to, Garry Knapp
felt it would be wrong to accept the sacrifice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>The chances of business life, especially for a
young man with the small experience and the small
capital he would have, were too great. To “tie a
girl up” under such circumstances was a thing
Garry could not contemplate and keep his self-respect.
He would not, he told himself, be led
even to admit by word or look that he desired to
be Dorothy’s suitor.</p>

<p>To hide this desire during the few days he remained
at The Cedars was the hardest task Garry
Knapp had ever undertaken. If Dorothy was
demure and modest she was likewise determined.
Her happiness, she felt, was at stake and although
she could but admire the attitude Garry held upon
this momentous question she did not feel that he
was right.</p>

<p>“Why, what does it matter about money—mere
money?” she said one night to Tavia, confessing
everything when her chum had crept into her bed
with her after the lights were out. “I believe I
care for money less than he does.”</p>

<p>“You bet you do!” ejaculated Tavia, vigorously.
“Just at present that young cowboy person
is caring more for money than Ananias did.
Money looks bigger to him than anything else in
the world. With money he could have you, Doro
Doodlekins—don’t you see?”</p>

<p>“But he can have me without!” wailed Dorothy,
burying her head in the pillow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, no he can’t,” Tavia said wisely and quietly.
“You know he can’t. If you could tempt him to
throw up his principles in the matter, you know
very well, Doro, that you would be heartbroken.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Yes you would. You wouldn’t want a young
man dangling after you who had thrown aside his
self-respect for a girl. Now, would you?” And
without waiting for an answer she continued: “Not
that I approve of his foolishness. Some men <em>are</em>
that way, however. Thank heaven I am not a
man.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I’m glad you’re not, either,” confessed
Dorothy with her soft lips now against Tavia’s
cheek.</p>

<p>“Thank you, ma’am. I have often thought I’d
like to be of the hemale persuasion; but never, no
more!” declared Tavia, with vigor. “Suppose <em>I</em>
should then be afflicted with an ingrowing conscience
about taking money from the woman I
married? Whe-e-e-ew!”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t have to,” murmured Dorothy,
burying her head again and speaking in a muffled
voice. “I’d give up the money.”</p>

<p>“And if he had any sense or unselfishness at all
he wouldn’t let you do <em>that</em>,” snapped Tavia.
“No. You couldn’t get along without much money
now, Dorothy.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span></p>

<p>“It is the truth. I know I should be hopelessly
unhappy myself if I had to go home and live again
just as they do there. I have been spoiled,” said
Tavia, her voice growing lugubrious. “I want
wealth—luxuries—and everything good that
money buys. Yes, Doro, when it comes <em>my</em> time
to become engaged, I must get a wealthy man or
none at all. I shall be put up at auction——”</p>

<p>“Tavia! How you talk! Ridiculous!” exclaimed
Dorothy. “You talk like a heathen.”</p>

<p>“Am one when it comes to money matters,”
groaned the girl. “I have got to marry
money——”</p>

<p>“If Nat White were as poor as a church mouse,
you’d marry him in a minute!”</p>

<p>“Oh—er—well,” sighed Tavia, “Nat is not going
to ask me, I am afraid.”</p>

<p>“He would in a minute if you’d tell him about
those Lance Petterby letters.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you dare tell him, Dorothy Dale!” exclaimed
Tavia, almost in fear. “You must not.
Now, promise.”</p>

<p>“I have promised,” her friend said gloomily.</p>

<p>“And see that you stick to it. I know,” said
Tavia, “that I could bring Nat back to me by explaining.
But there should be no need of explaining.
He should know that—that—oh, well,
what’s the use of talking! It’s all off!” and Tavia
flounced around and buried her nose in the pillow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>

<p>Dorothy’s wits were at work, however. In the
morning she “put a flea in Ned’s ear,” as Tavia
would have said, and Ned hurried off to the telegraph
office to send a day letter to his brother.
Dorothy did not censor that telegraph despatch
or this section of it would never have gone over
the wire:</p>
<br>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Come back home and take a squint at the
cowboy D. has picked out for herself.”</p>
</div>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII<br>
<span class="fs80">“IT’S ALL OFF!”</span></h2>
</div>

<p>By this time even Ned, dense as he sometimes
showed himself to be, was aware of how things
stood between the handsome stranger from the
West and his cousin Dorothy.</p>

<p>Ned’s heart was particularly warm at this juncture.
He spent a good two hours every forenoon
writing a long letter to Jennie.</p>

<p>“What under the sun he finds to write about
gets <em>me</em>,” declared Tavia. “He must indite sonnets
to her eyebrows or the like. I never did believe
that Ned White would fall so low as to be a
poet.”</p>

<p>“Love plays funny tricks with us,” sighed Dorothy.</p>

<p>“Huh!” ejaculated Tavia, wide-eyed. “Do you
feel like writing poetry yourself, Doro Dale? I
vum!”</p>

<p>However, to return to Ned, when his letter
writing was done he was at the beck and call of
the girls or was off with Garry Knapp for the rest
of the day. Toward Garry he showed the same
friendliness that his mother displayed and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
major showed. They all liked the young man
from Desert City; and they could not help admiring
his character, although they could not believe
him either wise or just to Dorothy.</p>

<p>The situation was delicate in the extreme. As
Dorothy and Garry had never approached the subject
of their secret attachment for each other, and
now, of course, did not speak of it to the others,
not even Ned could blunder into any opening
wherein he might “out with his opinion” to the
Westerner.</p>

<p>Garry Knapp showed nothing but the most gentlemanly
regard for Dorothy. After that first
evening on the ice, he did not often allow himself
to be left alone in her company. He knew very
well wherein his own weakness lay.</p>

<p>He talked frankly of his future intentions. It
had been agreed between him and Major Dale
that the old Knapp ranch should be turned over to
the Hardin estate lawyers when Garry went back
West at a price per acre that was generous, as
Garry said, but not so much above the market
value that he would be “ashamed to look the lawyers
in the face when he took the money.”</p>

<p>Just what Garry would do with these few thousands
he did not know. His education had been a
classical one. He had taken up nothing special
save mineralogy, and that only because of Uncle
Terry’s lifelong interest in “prospects.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p>“I boned like a good fellow,” he told Ned, “on
that branch just to please the old fellow. Of
course, I’d tagged along with him on a burro on
many a prospecting trip when I was a kid, and had
learned a lot of prospector’s lore from the dear
old codger.</p>

<p>“But what the old prospector knows about his
business is a good deal like what the old-fashioned
farmer knows about growing things. He does
certain things because they bring results, but the
old farmer doesn’t know why. Just so with the
old-time prospector. Uncle Terry’s scientific
knowledge of minerals wasn’t a spoonful. I
showed him things that made his eyes bug out—as
we say in the West,” and Garry laughed reminiscently.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t have thought he’d ever have quarreled
with you,” said Ned, having heard this fact
from the girls. “You must have been helpful to
him.”</p>

<p>“That’s the reef we were wrecked on,” said
Garry, shaking his head rather sadly.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean it! How?” queried Ned.</p>

<p>“Why, I’ll tell you. I don’t talk of it much.
Of course, you understand Uncle Terry is one of
the old timers. He’s lived a rough life and associated
with rough men for most of it. And his
slant on moral questions is not—well—er—what
yours and mine would be, White.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>

<p>“I see,” said Ned, nodding. “You collided on
a matter of ethics?”</p>

<p>“As you might say,” admitted Garry. “There
are abandoned diggings all over the West, especially
where gold was found in rich deposits that
can now be dug over and, by scientific methods,
made to yield comfortable fortunes.</p>

<p>“Why, in the early rush the metal, silver, was
not thought of! The miners cursed the black stuff
which got in their way and later proved to be almost
pure silver ore. Other valuable metals were
neglected, too. The miners could see nothing but
yellow. They were gold crazy.”</p>

<p>“I see,” Ned agreed. “It must have been great
times out there in those early days.”</p>

<p>“Ha!” exclaimed Garry. “For every ounce of
gold mined in the old times there was a man
wasted. The early gold mining cost more in men
than a war, believe me! However, that isn’t the
point, or what I was telling you about.</p>

<p>“Some time after I left the university Uncle
Terry wanted me to go off on a prospecting trip
with him and I went—just for the holiday, you
understand. These last few years he hasn’t made
a strike. He has plenty of money, anyway; but
the wanderlust of the old prospector seizes him
and he just has to pack up and go.</p>

<p>“We struck Seeper’s Gulch. It was some strike
in its day, about thirty years ago. The gold hunters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
dug fortunes out of that gulch, and then the
Chinese came in and raked over and sifted the
refuse. You’d think there wasn’t ten cents worth
of valuable metal left in that place, wouldn’t
you?”</p>

<p>Ned nodded, keenly interested in the story.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s what the old man thought. He
made all kinds of jokes over a squatter’s family
that had picketed there and were digging and toiling
over the played out claims.</p>

<p>“It seemed that they held legal title to a big
patch of the gulch. Some sharper had sawed off
the claim on them for good, hard-earned money;
and here they were, broke and desperate. Why!
there hadn’t been any gold mined there for years
and years, and their title, although perfectly legal,
wasn’t worth a cent—or so it seemed.</p>

<p>“Uncle Terry tried to show them that. They
were stubborn. They had to be, you see,” said
Garry, shaking his head. “Every hope they had
in the world was right in that God-forsaken gulch.</p>

<p>“Well,” he sighed, “I got to mooning around,
impatient to be gone, and I found something. It
was so plain that I wonder I didn’t fall over it
and break my neck,” and Garry laughed.</p>

<p>“What was it? Not gold?”</p>

<p>“No. Copper. And a good, healthy lead of
it. I traced the vein some distance before I would
believe it myself. And the bulk of it seemed to lie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
right inside the boundaries of that supposedly
worthless claim those poor people had bought.</p>

<p>“I didn’t dare tell anybody at first. I had to
figure out how she could be mined (for copper mining
isn’t like washing gold dust) and how the ore
could be taken to the crusher. The old roads were
pretty good, I found. It wouldn’t be much of a
haul from Seeper’s Gulch to town.</p>

<p>“Then I told Uncle Terry—and showed him.”</p>

<p>Ned waited, looking at Garry curiously.</p>

<p>“That—that’s where he and I locked horns,”
sighed Garry. “Uncle Terry was for offering to
buy the claim for a hundred dollars. He had that
much in his jeans and the squatters were desperate—meat
and meal all out and not enough gold in
the bottom of the pans to color a finger-ring.”</p>

<p>He was silent again for a moment, and then continued:</p>

<p>“I couldn’t see it. To take advantage of the
ignorance of that poor family wasn’t a square deal.
Uncle Terry lost his head and then lost his temper.
To stop him from making any such deal I
out with my story and showed those folks just
where they stood. A little money would start ’em,
and I lent them that——”</p>

<p>“But your Uncle Terry?” asked Ned, curiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, he went off mad. I saw the squatters
started right and then made for home. I was
some time getting there——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>“You cleaned yourself out helping the owners
of the claim?” put in Ned, shrewdly.</p>

<p>“Why—yes, I did. But that was nothing. I’d
been broke before. I got a job here and there to
carry me along. But when I reached home Uncle
Terry had hiked out for Alaska and left a letter
with a lawyer for me. I was the one bad egg in
the family,” and Garry laughed rather ruefully,
“so he said. He’d rather give his money to build
a rattlesnake home than to me. So that’s where
we stand to-day. And you see, White, I did not
exactly prepare myself for any profession or any
business, depending as I was on Uncle Terry’s
bounty.”</p>

<p>“Tough luck,” announced Ned White.</p>

<p>“It was very foolish on my part. No man
should look forward to another’s shoes. If I had
gone ahead with the understanding that I had my
own row to hoe when I got through school, believe
me, I should have picked my line long before I
left the university and prepared accordingly.</p>

<p>“I figure that I’m set back several years. With
this little bunch of money your uncle is going to
pay me for my old ranch I have got to get into
something that will begin to turn me a penny at
once. Not so easy to do, Mr. White.”</p>

<p>“But what about the folks you steered into the
copper mine?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, they are making out fairly well. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
no great fortune, but a good paying proposition
and may keep going for years. Copper is away
up now, you know. They paid me back the loan
long ago. But poor old Uncle Terry—well, he is
still sore, and I guess he will remain so for the
remainder of his natural. I’m sorry for him.”</p>

<p>“And not for yourself?” asked Ned, slyly.</p>

<p>“Why, I’d be glad if he’d back me in something.
Developing my ranch into wheat land, for instance.
Money lies that way, I believe. But it
takes two or three years to get going and lots of
money for machinery. Can’t raise wheat out there
in a small way. It means tractors, and gangplows
and all such things. Whew! no use thinking of
that now,” and Garry heaved a final sigh.</p>

<p>He had not asked Ned to keep the tale to himself;
therefore, the family knew the particulars
of Garry Knapp’s trouble with his uncle in a short
time. It was the one thing needed to make Major
Dale, at least, desire to keep in touch with the
young Westerner.</p>

<p>“I’m not surprised that he looks upon any understanding
with Dorothy in the way he does,”
the major said to Aunt Winnie. “He is a high-minded
fellow—no doubt of it. And I believe he
is no namby-pamby. He will go far before he gets
through. I’ll prophesy that.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear Major,” said his sister, with a
rather tremulous smile, “it may be years before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
such an honorable young man as Garry Knapp will
acquire a competence sufficient to encourage him
to come after our Dorothy.”</p>

<p>“Well—er——”</p>

<p>“And they need each other <em>now</em>,” went on
Mrs. White, with assurance, “while they are young
and can get the good of youth and of life itself.
Not after their hearts are starved by long and impatient
waiting.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the young idiot!” growled the major,
shaking his head.</p>

<p>Aunt Winnie laughed, although there was still
a tremor in her voice. “You call him high-minded
and an idiot——”</p>

<p>“He is both,” growled Major Dale. “Perhaps,
to be cynical, one might say that in this day and
generation the two attributes go together! I—I
wish I knew the way out.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” sighed Mrs. White. “For Dorothy’s
sake,” she added.</p>

<p>“For both their sakes,” said the major. “For,
believe me, this young man isn’t having a very
good time, either.”</p>

<p>Tavia wished she might “cut the Gordian
knot,” as she expressed it. Ned would have gladly
shown Garry a way out of the difficulty. And
Dorothy Dale could do nothing!</p>

<p>“What helpless folk we girls are, after all,” she
confessed to Tavia. “I thought I was being so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
bold, so brave, in getting Garry to come East. I
believed I had solved the problem through father’s
aid. And look at it now! No farther toward
what I want than before.”</p>

<p>“Garry Knapp is a—a chump!” exclaimed
Tavia, with some heat.</p>

<p>“But a very lovable chump,” added Dorothy,
smiling patiently. “Oh, dear! It must be his decision,
not mine, after all. I tell you, even the
most modern of girls are helpless in the end. The
man decides.”</p>

<p>Nat came back to North Birchland in haste. It
needed only a word—even from his brother—to
bring him. Perhaps he would have met Tavia
as though no misunderstanding had arisen between
them had she been willing to ignore their difficulty.</p>

<p>But when he kissed Dorothy and his mother,
and turned to Tavia, she put out her hand and
looked Nat sternly in the eye. He knew better
than to make a joke of his welcome home with
her. She had raised the barrier herself and she
meant to keep it up.</p>

<p>“The next time you kiss me it must be in solemn
earnest.”</p>

<p>She had said that to Nat and she proposed to
abide by it. The old, cordial, happy-go-lucky comradeship
could never be renewed. Nat realized
that suddenly and dropped his head as he went
indoors with his bag.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>He had returned almost too late to meet Garry
Knapp after all. The Westerner laughingly protested
that he had loafed long enough. He had
to run down to New York for a day or so to attend
to some business for Bob Douglas and then
must start West.</p>

<p>“Come back here before you really start for the
‘wild and woolly,’” begged Ned. “We’ll get up a
real house party——”</p>

<p>“Tempt me not!” cried Garry, with hand
raised. “It is hard enough for me to pull my
freight now. If I came again I’d only have to—well!
it would be harder, that’s all,” and his
usually hopeful face was overcast.</p>

<p>“Remember you leave friends here, my boy,”
said the major, when he saw the young man alone
the evening before his departure. “You’ll find no
friends anywhere who will be more interested in
your success than these at The Cedars.”</p>

<p>“I believe you, Major. I wish I could show my
appreciation of your kindness in a greater degree
by accepting your offer to help me. But I can’t
do it. It wouldn’t be right.”</p>

<p>“No. From your standpoint, I suppose it
wouldn’t,” admitted the major, with a sigh. “But
at least you’ll correspond——”</p>

<p>“Ned and I are going to write each other frequently—we’ve
got quite chummy, you know,”
and Garry laughed. “You shall all hear of me.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
And thank you a thousand times for your interest
Major Dale!”</p>

<p>“But my interest hasn’t accomplished what I
wanted it to accomplish,” muttered the old gentleman,
as Garry turned away.</p>

<p>Dorothy showed a brave face when the time
came for Garry’s departure. She did not make
an occasion for seeing him alone, as she might
easily have done. Somehow she felt bound in
honor—in Garry’s honor—not to try to break
down his decision. She knew he understood her;
and she understood Garry. Why make the
parting harder by any talk about it?</p>

<p>But Tavia’s observation as Garry was whirled
away by Ned in the car for the railway station,
sounded like a knell in Dorothy Dale’s ears.</p>

<p>“It’s all off!” remarked Tavia.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE CASTAWAYS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Drifts covered the fences and fitted every evergreen
about The Cedars with a white cap. The
snow had come quite unexpectedly and in the arms
of a blizzard.</p>

<p>For two days and nights the storm had raged
all over the East. Wires were down and many
railroad trains were blocked. New York City
was reported snowbound.</p>

<p>“I bet old Garry is holed up in the hotel there
all right,” said Ned. “He’d never have got away
before the storm.”</p>

<p>Dorothy hoped Garry had not started for the
West and had become snowbound in some train;
but she said nothing about it.</p>

<p>It took two full days for the roads to be broken
around North Birchland. And then, of course, to
use an automobile was quite impossible.</p>

<p>The Dale boys were naturally delighted, for
there was no school for several days and snow-caves,
snowmen and snow monuments of all kind
were constructed all over the White lawns.</p>

<p>Nor were Joe and Roger alone in these out-of-door<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
activities. The girls, as well as Ned and
Nat, lent their assistance, and Tavia proved to be
a fine snow sculptor.</p>

<p>“Always was. Believe I might learn to work
putty and finally become a great sculptor,” she declared.
“At Glenwood they said I had a talent
for composition.”</p>

<p>“What kind of figure do you prefer to sculp,
Tavia?” asked Ned, with curiosity.</p>

<p>“Oh, I think I should just <em>love</em> a job in an ice-cream
factory, turning out works of art for parties
and banquets. Or making little figures on New
Year’s and birthday cakes. And then—think of
all the nice ‘eats’!”</p>

<p>“Oh! I’d like to do that,” breathed Roger, with
round eyes.</p>

<p>“Now, see,” laughed Dorothy, “you have
started Roger, perhaps, in a career. He does love
ice-cream and cake.”</p>

<p>At least the joke started something else if it did
not point Roger on the road to fame as an “ice-cream
sculptor.” The boy was inordinately fond
of goodies and Tavia promised him a treat just
as soon as ever she could get into town.</p>

<p>A few days before Tavia had been the recipient
of a sum of money from home. When he had
any money himself Mr. Travers never forgot his
pretty daughter’s need. He was doing very well
in business now, as well as holding a political position<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
that paid a good salary. This money she
had received was of course burning a hole in
Tavia’s pocket. She must needs get into town
as soon as the roads were passable, to buy goodies
as her contract with Roger called for.</p>

<p>The horses had not been out of the stable for a
week and the coachman admitted they needed exercise.
So he was to drive Tavia to town directly
after breakfast. It was washday, however, and
something had happened to the furnace in the
laundry. The coachman was general handy man
about the White premises, and he was called upon
to fix the furnace just as Tavia—and the horses—were
ready.</p>

<p>“But who’ll drive me?” asked Tavia, looking
askance at the spirited span that the boy from
the stables was holding. “Goodness! aren’t they
full of ginger?”</p>

<p>“Better wait till afternoon,” advised Dorothy.</p>

<p>“But they are all ready, and so am I. Besides,”
said Tavia with a glance at Roger’s doleful face,
“somebody smells disappointment.”</p>

<p>Roger understood and said, trying to speak
gruffly:</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mind.”</p>

<p>“No. I see you don’t,” Tavia returned dryly,
and just then Nat appeared on the porch in bearskin
and driving gloves.</p>

<p>“Get in, Tavia, if you want to go. The horses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
need the work, anyway; and the coachman may be
all day at that furnace.”</p>

<p>“Oh—I—ah——” began Tavia. Then she
closed her lips and marched down the steps and
got into the cutter. Whatever her feeling about
the matter, she was not going to attract everybody’s
attention by backing out.</p>

<p>Nat tucked the robes around her and got in
himself. Then he gathered up the reins, the boy
sprang out of the way, and they were off.</p>

<p>With the runners of the light sleigh humming
at their heels the horses gathered speed each moment.
Nat hung on to the reins and the roses began
to blow in Tavia’s cheeks and the fire of excitement
burn in her eyes.</p>

<p>How she loved to travel fast! And in riding
beside Nat the pleasure of speed for her was
always doubled. Whether it was in the automobile,
or behind the galloping blacks, as now, to
speed along the highways by Nat’s side was a delight.</p>

<p>The snow was packed just right for sleighing
and the wildly excited span tore into town at racing
speed. Indeed, so excited were the horses that
Nat thought it better not to stop anywhere until
the creatures had got over their first desire to
run.</p>

<p>So they swept through the town and out upon
the road to The Beeches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t mind, do you?” Nat stammered, casting
a quick, sidelong glance at Tavia.</p>

<p>“Oh, Nat! it’s wonderful!” she gasped, but
looked straight ahead.</p>

<p>“Good little sport—the best ever!” groaned
Nat; but perhaps she did not hear the compliment
thus wrested from him.</p>

<p>He turned into the upper road for The Beeches,
believing it would be more traveled than the other
highway. In this, however, he was proved mistaken
in a very few minutes. The road breakers
had not been far on this highway, so the blacks
were soon floundering through the drifts and were
rapidly brought down to a sensible pace.</p>

<p>“Say! this is altogether too rough,” Nat declared.
“It’s no fun being tossed about like beans
in a sack. I’d better turn ’em around.”</p>

<p>“You’ll tip us over, Nat,” objected Tavia.</p>

<p>“Likely to,” admitted the young man. “So
we’d better both hop out while I perform the
necessary operation.”</p>

<p>“Maybe they will get away from you,” she
cried with some fear. “Be careful.”</p>

<p>“Watch your Uncle Nat,” he returned lightly.
“I’ll not let them get away.”</p>

<p>Tavia was the last person to be cautious; so
she hopped out into the snow on her side of the
sleigh while Nat alighted on the other. A sharp
pull on the bits and the blacks were plunging in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
the drift to one side of the half beaten track.
Tavia stepped well back out of the way.</p>

<p>The horses breasted the deep snow, snorting
and tossing their heads. Their spirits were not
quenched even after this long and hard dash from
The Cedars.</p>

<p>The sleigh did go over on its side; but Nat
righted it quickly. This, however, necessitated
his letting go of the reins with one hand.</p>

<p>The next moment the sleigh came with a terrific
shock into collision with an obstruction. It was a
log beside the road, completely hidden in the snow.</p>

<p>Frightened, the horses plunged and kicked.
The doubletree snapped and the reins were jerked
from Nat’s grasp. The horses leaped ahead,
squealing and plunging, tearing the harness completely
from their backs. The sleigh remained
wedged behind the log; but the animals were freed
and tore away along the road, back toward North
Birchland.</p>

<p>Tavia had made no outcry; but now, in the
midst of the snow cloud that had been kicked up,
she saw that Nat was floundering in the drift.</p>

<p>“Oh, Nat! are you hurt?” she moaned, and ran
to him.</p>

<p>But he was already gingerly getting upon his
feet. He had lost his cap, and the neck of his
coat, where the big collar flared away, was packed
with snow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span></p>

<p>“Badly hurt—in my dignity,” he growled. “Oh
gee, Tavia! Come and scoop some of this snow
out of my neck.”</p>

<p>She giggled at that. She could not help it, for
he looked really funny. Nevertheless she lent
him some practical aid, and after he had shaken
himself out of the loose snow and found his cap,
he could grin himself at the situation.</p>

<p>“We’re castaway in the snow, just the same,
old girl,” he said. “What’ll we do—start back
and go through North Birchland, the beheld of
all beholders, or take the crossroad back to The
Cedars—and so save a couple of miles?”</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s go home the quickest way,” she said.
“I—I don’t want to be the laughing stock for the
whole town.”</p>

<p>“My fault, Tavia. I’m sorry,” he said ruefully.</p>

<p>“No more your fault than it was mine,” she
said loyally.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes it was,” he groaned, looking at her
seriously. “And it always <em>is</em> my fault.”</p>

<p>“What is always your fault?” she asked him
but tremulously and stepping back a little.</p>

<p>“Our scraps, Tavia. Our big scrap. I <em>know</em>
I ought not to have questioned you about that old
letter. Oh, hang it, Tavia! don’t you see just how
sorry and ashamed I am?” he cried boyishly, putting
out both gloved hands to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>“I—I know this isn’t just the way to tell you—or
the place. But my heart just <em>aches</em> because of
that scrap, Tavia. I don’t care how many letters
you have from other people. I know there’s nothing
out of the way in them. I was just jealous—and—and
mean——”</p>

<p>“Anybody tell you why Lance Petterby was
writing to me?” put in Tavia sternly.</p>

<p>“No. Of course not. <em>Hang</em> Lance Petterby,
anyway——”</p>

<p>“Oh, that would be too bad. His wife would
feel dreadfully if Lance were hung.”</p>

<p>“<em>What!</em>”</p>

<p>“I knew you were still jealous of poor Lance,”
Tavia shot in, wagging her head. “And that word
proves it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care. I said what I meant before I
knew he was married. <em>Is</em> he?” gasped Nat.</p>

<p>“Very much so. They’ve got a baby girl and
I’m its godmother. Octavia Susan Petterby.”</p>

<p>“Tavia!” Nat whispered still holding out his
hands. “Do—do you forgive me?”</p>

<p>“Now! is this a time or a place to talk things
over?” she demanded apparently inclined to keep
up the wall. “We are castaway in the snow.
Bo-o-ooh! we’re likely to freeze here——”</p>

<p>“I don’t care if I do freeze,” he declared recklessly.
“You’ve got to answer me here and now,
Tavia.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>“Have I?” with a toss of her head. “Who
are <em>you</em> to command <em>me</em>, I’d like to know?” Then
with sudden seriousness and a flood of crimson
in her face that fairly glorified Tavia Travers:
“How about that request I told you your mother
must make, Nat? I meant it.”</p>

<p>“See here! See here!” cried the young man,
tearing off his gloves and dashing them into the
snow while he struggled to open his bearskin coat
and then the coat beneath.</p>

<p>From an inner pocket he drew forth a letter
and opened it so she could read.</p>

<p>“See!” Nat cried. “It’s from mother. She
wrote it to me while I was in Boston—before old
Ned’s telegram came. See what she says here—second
paragraph, Tavia.”</p>

<p>The girl read the words with a little intake of
her breath:</p>
<br>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And, my dear boy, I know that you have quarreled
in some way and for some reason with our
pretty, impetuous Tavia. Do not risk your own
happiness and hers, Nathaniel, through any stubbornness.
Tavia is worth breaking one’s pride
for. She is the girl I hope to see you marry—nobody
else in this wide world could so satisfy me
as your wife.”</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>That was as far as Tavia could read, for her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
eyes were misty. She hung her head like a child
and whispered, as Nat approached:</p>

<p>“Oh, Nat! Nat! how I doubted her! She is
<em>so</em> good!”</p>

<p>He put his arms about her, and she snuggled
up against the bearskin coat.</p>

<p>“Say! how about <em>me</em>?” he demanded huskily.
“Now that the Widder White has asked you to be
her daughter-in-law, don’t I come into the picture
at all?”</p>

<p>Tavia raised her head, looked at him searchingly,
and suddenly laid her lips against his eager
ones.</p>

<p>“You’re—you’re the <em>whole</em> picture for me,
Nat!” she breathed.</p>

<span class="fs80">SOMETHING AMAZING</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Now that Garry Knapp had left The Cedars—had
passed out of her life forever perhaps—Dorothy
Dale found herself in a much disturbed
state of mind. She did not wish to sit and think
over her situation. If she did she knew she would
break down.</p>

<p>She was tempted—oh! sorely tempted—to
write Garry Knapp all that was in her heart. Her
cheeks burned when she thought of doing such a
thing; yet, after all, she was fighting for happiness
and as she saw it receding from her she grew desperate.</p>

<p>But Dorothy Dale had gone as far as she could.
She had done her best to bring the man she loved
into line with her own thought. She had the satisfaction
of believing he felt toward her as she did
toward him. But there matters stood; she could
do no more. She did not let her mind dwell upon
this state of affairs; she could not and retain that
calm expected of Dorothy Dale by the rest of the
family at The Cedars. It is what is expected of
us that we accomplish, after all. She had never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
been in the habit of giving away to her feelings,
even as a schoolgirl. Much more was expected of
her now.</p>

<p>The older people about her were, of course,
sympathetic. She would have been glad to get
away from them for that very reason. Whenever
Tavia looked at her Dorothy saw commiseration
in her eyes. So, too, with Aunt Winnie
and the major. Dorothy turned with relief to
her brothers who had not much thought for anything
but fun and frolic.</p>

<p>Joe and Roger had quite fallen in love with
Garry Knapp and talked a good deal about him.
But their talk was innocent enough and was not
aimed at her. They had not discovered—as they
had regarding Jennie Hapgood and Ned—that
their big sister was in the toils of this strange new
disease that seemed to have smitten the young folk
at The Cedars.</p>

<p>On this very day that Tavia had elected to go
to town and Nat had driven her in the cutter,
Dorothy put on her wraps for a tramp through
the snow. As she started toward the back road
she saw Joe and Roger coming away from the
kitchen door, having been whisked out by the cook.</p>

<p>“Take it all and go and don’t youse boys be
botherin’ me again to-day—and everything behind
because of the wash,” cried Mary, as the boys
departed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span></p>

<p>“What have you been bothering Mary for?”
asked Dorothy, hailing her brothers.</p>

<p>“Suet,” said Joe.</p>

<p>“Oh, do come on, Sister,” cried the eager
Roger. “We’re going to feed ’em.”</p>

<p>“Feed what?” asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>“The bluejays and the clapes and the snow
buntings,” Roger declared.</p>

<p>“With suet?”</p>

<p>“That’s for the jays,” explained Joe. “We’ve
got plenty of cracked corn and oats for the little
birds. You see, we tie the chunks of suet up in
the trees—and you ought to see the bluejays come
after it!”</p>

<p>“Do come with us,” begged Roger again, who
always found a double pleasure in having Dorothy
attend them on any venture.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. You boys have grown so you
can keep ahead of me,” laughed Dorothy.
“Where are you going—how far?”</p>

<p>“Up to Snake Hill—there by the gully. Mr.
Garry Knapp showed us last week,” Joe said.
“He says he always feeds the birds in the winter
time out where he lives.”</p>

<p>Dorothy smiled and nodded. “I should presume
he did,” she said. “He is that kind—isn’t
he, boys?”</p>

<p>“He’s bully,” said Roger, with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“<em>What</em> kind?” asked Joe, with some caution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span></p>

<p>“Just kind,” laughed Dorothy. “Kind to everybody
and everything. Birds and all,” she said.
But to herself she thought: “Kind to everybody
but poor little me!”</p>

<p>However, she went on with her brothers. They
plowed through the drifts in the back road, but
found the going not as hard as in the woods. The
tramp to the edge of the gully into which the boys
had come so near to plunging on their sled weeks
before, was quite exhausting.</p>

<p>This distant spot had been selected because of
the number of birds that always were to be found
here, winter or summer. The undergrowth was
thick and the berries and seeds tempted many of
the songsters and bright-plumaged birds to remain
beyond the usual season for migration.</p>

<p>Then it would be too late for them to fly South
had they so desired. Now, with the heavy snow
heaped upon everything edible, the feathered creatures
were going to have a time of famine if they
were not thought of by their human neighbors.</p>

<p>Sparrows and chicadees are friendly little things
and will keep close to human habitations in winter;
but the bluejay, that saucy rascal, is always shy.
He and his wilder brothers must be fed in the
woods.</p>

<p>There were the tracks of the birds—thousands
and thousands of tracks about the gully. Roger
began to throw out the grain, scattering it carefully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
on the snowcrust, while Joe climbed up the
first tree with a lump of suet tied to a cord.</p>

<p>“I got to tie it high,” he told Dorothy, who
asked him, “’cause otherwise, Mr. Knapp says,
dogs or foxes, or such like, will get it instead of
the birds.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see,” Dorothy said. “Look where you
step, Roger. See! the gully is level full of snow.
What a drift!”</p>

<p>This was true. The snow lay in the hollow
from twenty to thirty feet in depth. None of the
Dales could remember seeing so much snow before.</p>

<p>Dorothy held the other pieces of suet for Joe
while he climbed the second tree. It was during
this process that she suddenly missed Roger. She
could not hear him nor see him.</p>

<p>“Roger!” she called.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you?” demanded Joe
tartly. “You’re scaring the birds.”</p>

<p>“But Roger is scaring <em>me</em>,” his sister told him.
“Look, Joe, from where you are. Can you see
him? Is he hiding from us?”</p>

<p>Joe gave a glance around; then he hastened to
descend the tree.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Dorothy worriedly.
“What has happened to him?”</p>

<p>Joe said never a word, but hastened along the
bank of the gully. They could scarcely distinguish
the line of the bank in some places and right at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
the very steepest part was a wallow in the snow.
Something had sunk down there and the snow had
caved in after it!</p>

<p>“Roger!” gasped Dorothy, her heart beating
fast and the muscles of her throat tightening.</p>

<p>“Oh, cricky!” groaned Joe. “He’s gone down.”</p>

<p>It was the steepest and deepest part of the gully.
Not a sound came up from the huge drift into
which the smaller boy had evidently tumbled—no
answer to their cries.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Dorothy and her brothers had scarcely gone out
of sight of the house when Major Dale, looking
from the broad front window of his room, beheld
a figure plowing through the heaped up snow and
in at the gateway of The Cedars. It was not Nat
and it was not Ned; at first he did not recognize
the man approaching the front door at all.</p>

<p>Then he suddenly uttered a shout which brought
the housemaid from her dusting in the hall.</p>

<p>“Major Dale! what is it, please? Can I do
anything for you?” asked the girl, her hand upon
her heart.</p>

<p>“Great glory! did I scare you, Mina?” he demanded.
“Well! I’m pretty near scared myself.
Leastways, I am amazed. Run down and open
the door for Mr. Knapp—and bring him right up
here.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Knapp!” cried the maid, and was away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
on swift feet, for Garry had endeared himself to
the serving people as well as to the family during
his brief stay at The Cedars.</p>

<p>The young man threw aside his outer clothing
in haste and ran upstairs to the major’s room.
Dorothy’s father had got up in his excitement
and was waiting for him with eager eyes.</p>

<p>“Garry! Garry Knapp!” he exclaimed. “What
has happened? What has brought you back here,
my dear boy?”</p>

<p>Garry was smiling, but it was a grave smile.
Indeed, something dwelt in the young man’s eyes
that the major had never seen before.</p>

<p>“What is it?” repeated the old gentleman, as he
seized Garry’s hand.</p>

<p>“Major, I’ve come to ask a favor,” blurted out
the Westerner.</p>

<p>“A favor—and at last?” cried Major Dale.
“It is granted.”</p>

<p>“Wait till you hear what it is—all of it. First
I want you to call our bargain off.”</p>

<p>“What? You don’t want to sell your ranch?”
gasped the major.</p>

<p>“No, sir. Things have—well, have changed a
bit. My ranch is something that I must not sell,
for I can see a way now to work it myself.”</p>

<p>“You can, my boy? You can develop it? Then
the bargain’s off!” cried the major. “I only want
to see you successful.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span></p>

<p>“Thank you, sir. You are more than kind—kinder
than I have any reason to expect. And I
presume you think me a fellow of fluctuating intentions,
eh?” and he laughed shortly.</p>

<p>“I am waiting to hear about that, Garry,” said
the major, eyeing him intently.</p>

<p>With a thrill in his voice that meant joy, yet
with eyes that were frankly bedimmed with tears,
Garry Knapp put a paper into Major Dale’s hand,
saying:</p>

<p>“Read that, Major,—read that and tell me what
you think of it.”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX<br>
<span class="fs80">SO IT WAS ALL SETTLED</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“What’s this—what’s this, my boy?” cried the
major hastily adjusting his reading glasses. “A
telegram? And from the West, eh?”</p>

<p>“A night letter from Bob Douglas. I got it
yesterday morning. I’ve been all this time getting
here, Major. Believe me! the railroads are badly
blocked.”</p>

<p>Major Dale was reading the telegram. His
face flushed and his eyes brightened as he read.</p>

<p>“This is authentic, Garry?” he finally asked,
with shaking voice.</p>

<p>“Sure. I know Bob Douglas—and Gibson, the
lawyer, too. Gibson has been in touch with the poor
old man all the time. I expect Uncle Terry must
have left the will and all his papers with Gibson
when he hiked out for Alaska. Poor, poor old
man! He’s gone without my ever having seen
him again.” Garry’s voice was broken and he
turned to look out of the window.</p>

<p>“Not your fault, my boy,” said the major, clearing
his throat.</p>

<p>“No, sir. But my misfortune. I know now that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
the old man loved me or he would not have made
me rich in the end.”</p>

<p>Major Dale was reading the long telegram
again. “Your friend, Mr. Douglas, repeats a
phrase of the will, it is evident,” he said softly.
“Your uncle says you are to have his money ‘because
you are too honest to ever make any for
yourself.’ Do you believe that, Garry?” and his
eyes suddenly twinkled.</p>

<p>Garry Knapp blushed and shook his head negatively.
“That’s just the old man’s caustic wit,”
he said. “I’ll make good all right. I’ve got the
land, and now I’ve got the money to develop
it——”</p>

<p>“Major Dale! Where is Miss Dorothy?”</p>

<p>“Gone out for a tramp in the snow. I heard
her with the boys,” said the major, smiling. “I—I
expect, Garry, you wish to tell her the good
news?”</p>

<p>“And something else, Major, if you will permit
me.”</p>

<p>The old gentleman looked at him searchingly.
“I am not altogether sure that you deserve to get
her, Garry. You are a laggard in love,” he said.
“But you have my best wishes.”</p>

<p>“You’ll not find me slow that way after <em>this</em>!”
exclaimed Garry Knapp gaily, as he made for the
door.</p>

<p>Thus it was that, having traced Dorothy and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
her brothers from the house, the young Westerner
came upon the site of the accident to Roger just
as the girl and Joe discovered the disappearance
of the smaller boy in the deep drift.</p>

<p>“Run for help, Joe!” Dorothy was crying.
“Bring somebody! And ropes! No! don’t you
dare jump into that drift! Then there will be
two of you lost. Oh!”</p>

<p>“Hooray!” yelled Joe at that instant. “Here’s
Mr. Knapp!”</p>

<p>Dorothy could not understand Garry’s appearance;
but she had to believe her eyesight. Before
the young man, approaching now by great leaps,
had reached the spot they had explained the
trouble to him.</p>

<p>“Don’t be so frightened, Dorothy,” he cried.
“The boy won’t smother in that snowdrift. He’s
probably so scared that——”</p>

<p>Just then a muffled cry came to their ears from
below in the drifted gulch.</p>

<p>“He isn’t dead then!” declared Joe. “How’re
we going to get him out, Mr. Knapp?”</p>

<p>“By you and Miss Dorothy standing back out
of danger and letting me burrow there,” said
Garry.</p>

<p>He had already thrown aside his coat. Now
he leaped well out from the edge of the gully
bank, turning in the air so as to face them as he
plunged, feet first, into the drift.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span></p>

<p>It was partially hollowed out underneath—and
this fact Garry had surmised. The wind had
blown the snow into the gully, but a hovering
wreath of the frozen element had tempted Roger
upon its surface and then treacherously let him
down into the heart of it.</p>

<p>Garry plunged through and almost landed upon
the frightened boy. He groped for him, picked
him up in his arms, and the next minute Roger’s
head and shoulders burst through the snow crust
and he was tossed by Garry out upon the bank.</p>

<p>“Oh, Garry!” gasped Dorothy, trying to help
the man up the bank and out of the snow wreath.
“What ever should we have done without you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what you’re going to do without
me, anyway,” laughed the young man breathlessly,
finally recovering his feet.</p>

<p>“Garry!”</p>

<p>She looked at him almost in fear, gazing into
his flushed face. She saw that something had happened—something
that had changed his attitude
toward her; but she could not guess what it was.</p>

<p>The boys were laughing, and Joe was beating
the snow off the clothing of his younger brother.
They did not notice their elders for the moment.</p>

<p>“How——Why did you come back, Garry?”
the girl asked directly.</p>

<p>“I come back to see if you would let such a
blundering fellow as I am tell you what is in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
heart,” Garry said softly, looking at her with
serious gaze.</p>

<p>“Garry! What has happened?” she murmured.</p>

<p>He told her quietly, but with a break in his
voice that betrayed the depth of his feeling for
his Uncle Terry. “The poor old boy!” he said.
“If he had only showed me he loved me so while
he lived—and given me a chance to show him.”</p>

<p>“It is not your fault,” said Dorothy using the
words her father had used in commenting upon
the matter.</p>

<p>They were standing close together—there in the
snow, and his arms were about her. Dorothy
looked up bravely into his face.</p>

<p>“I—I guess I can’t say it very well, Dorothy.
But you know how I feel—how much I love you,
my dear. I’m going to make good out there on the
old ranch, and then I want to come back here for
you. Will you wait for me, Dorothy?”</p>

<p>“I expected to have to wait much longer than
that, Garry,” Dorothy replied with a tremulous
sigh. And then as he drew her still closer she
hid her face on his bosom.</p>

<p>“Lookut! Lookut!” cried Roger in the background,
suddenly observing the tableau. “What
do you know about Dorothy and Garry Knapp
doing it too?”</p>

<p>“Gee!” growled Joe, in disgust. “It must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
catching. Tavia and old Nat will get it. Come
on away, Roger. Huh! they don’t even know
we’re on earth.”</p>

<p>And it was some time before Dorothy Dale and
“that cowboy person” awoke to the fact that they
were alone and it was a much longer time still before
they started back for The Cedars, hand in
hand.</p>
